# Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) in Java

###### Understanding Improper Certificate Validation

**Improper Certificate Validation** is a security flaw that occurs when a web application fails to properly verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates. This can lead to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where an attacker can intercept and potentially alter the encrypted communication between a client and a server.

In Java web applications, this vulnerability often manifests incorrectly handling SSL/TLS certificates in client-side code. Some examples include accepting any certificate presented by a server or not verifying the TLS chain up to a trusted root authority.

### Common Variants and Injection Points

1. **Trusting All Certificates:**
   - Applications trust all certificates, effectively disabling TLS protections.
2. **Disabling Certificate Validation:**
   - Developers disable certificate verification for development or testing purposes and forget to re-enable it.
3. **Custom Trust Managers:**
   - Custom implementation of `X509TrustManager` that does not perform any checks.

**Common Injection Points:**
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

### Indicators of Success

1. **HTTP Response Status Codes:**
   - Look for status codes such as `500`, `502`, `503`, or `504` which might indicate SSL handshake errors.
2. **Response Body Messages:**
   - Specific error messages or stack traces related to SSL/TLS handshake failures.
3. **Headers:**
   - Absence of certain headers might indicate fallback to unencrypted communication.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

#### Zest Script for Detecting Known SSL Bypass Patterns

**Zest Script to Detect Hardcoded "Trust All" Certificates**

```json
{
  "type": "ZestScript",
  "version": "0.1",
  "title": "Detect Trust All Certificates",
  "description": "This script detects trusting all certificates in Java-based web applications.",
  "requests": [
    {
      "url": "https://target-app.com/",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "",
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }       
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 500,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
      "index": 1
    }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException",
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
      },
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ],
  "description": "Verifies if the response contains SSL handshake failure indicating possible trust-all configuration"
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Request Section:**
   - This defines a GET request to the target app URL: `https://target-app.com/`.
   
2. **Actions Section:**
   - A `ZestAssertion` that checks for HTTP status code `500`, indicating a server error possibly due to SSL issues.

3. **Assertions:**
   - Uses a `ZestConditionRegex` to detect if the response body contains `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException`, often indicating an SSL issue.

**Error Message Verification Script:**

```json
{
  "type": "ZestScript",
  "version": "0.1",
  "title": "Detect SSL Exception Messages",
  "description": "This script detects SSL exception messages in responses, indicating improper certificate validation.",
  "requests": [
    {
      "url": "https://target-app.com/",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "",
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }       
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 500,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
      "index": 1
    }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "SunCertPathBuilderException",
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
      },
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ],
  "description": "Checks for SunCertPathBuilderException in response indicating certificate path issues."
}
```

### Key Components of Zest Scripts

1. **ZestRequest:**
   - Used to define HTTP requests to be sent to the application.
   - Key elements include URL, method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and data.

2. **ZestAssertion:**
   - Used to validate the response against expected conditions.
   - Can check for specific status codes, response body content, headers, etc.

3. **ZestAction:**
   - Actions are operations such as failing a script on certain conditions.
   - Can include actions like failing the script if a vulnerability is detected via a ZestAssertion.

4. **ZestExpression:**
   - Allows logical expressions (AND, OR, NOT) to be utilized, providing flow control within the script.
   - Useful for implementing complex conditional logic.

### Explanation of Approach

The provided Zest scripts aim at detecting improper SSL/TLS certificate handling in Java-based web applications. Each script addresses a different aspect or variation of improper certificate validation, utilizing specific request definitions and assertions to accurately identify the vulnerability with minimal false positives and negatives.

- **Injection Points:** Commonly exploited points like URL parameters, headers, and request bodies are explicitly targeted.
- **Response Indicators:** Specific HTTP status codes and content patterns identified during research are used for failing assertions, ensuring robust detection mechanisms.
- **Mitigations:** Where applicable, actions to handle response verification and issue identification are added to aid in post-detection handling.

### Final Notes

These Zest scripts should be run within the OWASP ZAP environment and can be further customized based on the application-specific SSL/TLS handling patterns.
