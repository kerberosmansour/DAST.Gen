# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in Java

###### Understanding Unrestricted File Upload of Dangerous Type Vulnerabilities

**Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type** vulnerabilities allow attackers to upload harmful files to a web application, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities. In Java web applications, especially those using frameworks like Spring or Struts, this vulnerability typically manifests if file type validations are insufficient or improperly configured.

### Key Concepts in ZAP Zest Scripting 

Before diving into scripting, an understanding of key Zest components is essential:

1. **ZestRequest**: Defines an HTTP request.
2. **ZestAssertion**: Validates conditions in the HTTP response.
3. **ZestAction**: Executes an action, such as failing the script if a condition is not met.
4. **ZestExpression**: Adds logic to the script, like checking regex patterns.

### OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

We'll create Zest scripts examining different injection points (query parameters, headers, body), and detecting success indicators like error messages, status codes, or unexpected content in responses.

#### Zest Script 1: Testing File Upload via POST with Dangerous File Type

```json
{
  "title": "Test Dangerous File Upload via POST",
  "description": "This script simulates an unrestricted file upload vulnerability by uploading a dangerous file type.",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://target-application.com/upload",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "------boundary\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"malicious.jsp\"\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n\r\n<% out.println(\"Malicious Code Execution\"); %>\r\n------boundary--",
      "headers": "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----boundary",
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "regex": "Malicious Code Execution",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability detected",
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Request Setup**: This ZestRequest uses a POST method to upload a file named `malicious.jsp` which contains a simple JSP script that writes a string indicating potential malicious behavior.
2. **Assertions**:
   - **ZestExpressionStatusCode**: Verifies the HTTP 200 status code.
   - **ZestConditionRegex**: Checks the response body for the presence of the string "Malicious Code Execution".
3. **Actions**: Uses ZestActionFail to flag the test as failed if the regex condition is satisfied.

### Run and Manage the Script

- **Creating a new script in ZAP**: Right-click within ZAP, select "New Script", choose "Zest Script".
- **Adding Components**: Right-click to add requests, assertions, and other elements.
- **Executing Scripts**: Scripts can be run within the ZAP GUI or from the command line .

### Enhancements for Other Payload Types and Injection Points

To fully automate the testing of unrestricted file uploads in Java web applications, you may need more tailored scripts to cover additional file types, different endpoints, and alternative content-type headers.

### Documentation and Feedback

Additional enhancements, bug fixes, and contributions to Zest can be made via its GitHub repository .

Implementing ZAP Zest scripts for unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities should significantly enhance your web application security posture by enabling continuous and automated security testing.
