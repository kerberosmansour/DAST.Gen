# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in Java

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**:
Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can manipulate the application into using excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk, etc.). This type of vulnerability can lead to denial of service (DoS) by making the application unusable or slow down significantly. In Java-based web applications, these vulnerabilities can manifest in numerous ways:

- **Improper validation of input size**: Input fields that accept large payloads without proper checks.
- **Infinite loops**: Poorly constructed loops that do not terminate correctly.
- **Heavy computation**: Certain operations that are computationally expensive when executed repeatedly.
- **Unbounded data structures**: Using data structures without size restrictions, leading to memory exhaustion.

### Common Injection Points
In Java-based web applications, common injection points for uncontrolled resource consumption include:

- **URL parameters**: Query parameters that can be passed in the URL.
- **HTTP request bodies**: Large JSON, XML or other payloads that are processed by the server.
- **HTTP headers**: Special headers that may be manipulated to include large values.
- **Cookies**: Maliciously crafted cookies sent by the client.
- **Query strings**: SQL queries that when tampered can lead to heavy processing.

### Indicators of Success
To detect uncontrolled resource consumption, the following indicators may be used:

- **Error messages**: Specific errors indicating resource exhaustion (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).
- **Status codes**: HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) or 429 (Too Many Requests).
- **Response time**: A significant increase in server response time may indicate resource overload.
- **Content of the response**: Specific keywords or patterns in the response that hint at resource issues.

### Steps to Create OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for Detecting Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

#### 1. Create a Zest Request
Define the `ZestRequest` to simulate the attack vector. For resource consumption testing, you may craft a request with payloads designed to consume CPU or memory.

```json
{
  "url": "http://target-application/resource",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "data": "{ largePayload }",
  "index": 1,
  "elementType": "ZestRequest"
}
```

#### 2. Add a Zest Action
Include `ZestAction` elements to manipulate requests or responses as needed. For example, setting a delay to simulate prolonged operation.

```json
{
  "time": 5000,
  "elementType": "ZestActionSleep"
}
```

#### 3. Implement Zest Assertions
Use `ZestAssertion` to check for conditions (e.g., status code, response content) that indicate successful exploitation.

```json
{
  "rootExpression": {
    "code": 503,
    "not": false,
    "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
  },
  "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
}
```

#### 4. Use Zest Expressions
Incorporate `ZestExpression` to add logic and control flow, such as conditional checks for large response times.

```json
{
  "expression": {
    "type": "greaterThan",
    "value": 3000,
    "elementType": "ZestExpressionResponseTime"
  },
  "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
}
```

### Example of a Zest Script for Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

```json
{
  "title": "Detect Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via Large Payload",
  "zestVersion": "0.3",
  "statement": [
    {
      "url": "http://target-application/login",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "{largePayload}",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "time": 10000,
      "elementType": "ZestActionSleep"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 503,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "expression": {
        "type": "greaterThan",
        "value": 5000,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionResponseTime"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Documentation and Explanation
**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerabilities exploit the lack of proper resource limits in application components, and they can bring services to a halt. These vulnerabilities are often targeted through various injection points like URL parameters, HTTP headers, request bodies, and more.

**Zest Script Logic**:
- The script above initiates a request to a vulnerable endpoint with a payload designed to consume extensive resources.
- A sleep action is added to simulate a delay and observe the resource exhaustion effect.
- Assertions are put in place to check for error status codes and response times indicative of excessive resource usage.

**Minimizing False Positives and Negatives**:
- Ensuring payloads are realistic but designed to challenge resource limits.
- Validating error messages and response characteristics specific to resource issues.

By employing Zest scripts for this purpose, security testing becomes automated and systematic, leading to the effective identification of such vulnerabilities.

These scripts provide a practical way to automate detection, closely monitoring the application's responses to detect any signs of resource overuse, and thus, helps in maintaining the security and robustness of Java-based web applications.
