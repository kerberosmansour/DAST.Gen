# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in Java

ToTo create OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for detecting Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') vulnerabilities in Java web applications, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define and Understand the Vulnerability:**
   - Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') refers to the vulnerability where applications improperly resolve links or file paths, allowing attackers to access sensitive files or execute malicious files. It typically involves directory traversal or Local File Inclusion (LFI).

2. **Components of Zest Scripts:**
   - **ZestRequest:** Define the HTTP requests to simulate attacks.
   - **ZestAction:** Specify actions to take on requests or responses.
   - **ZestAssertion:** Check if the expected conditions (indicative of vulnerability presence) are met.
   - **ZestExpression:** Handle logic and control flow within the script.

3. **Common Injection Points:**
   - URL parameters
   - HTTP request bodies
   - HTTP headers
   - Cookies
   - Query strings

4. **Indicators of Success:**
   - Specific error messages in HTTP responses.
   - HTTP status codes indicating access to restricted directories (e.g., 200 OK for a sensitive file).
   - Specific patterns or contents in response bodies indicating successful exploitation.

5. **Zest Script Example:**

```json

  "about": "This Zest script detects Improper Link Resolution Before File Access vulnerabilities",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Link Following Detection",
  "description": "Detects improper link resolution or link following vulnerabilities.",
  "parameters": {
    "tokenStart": "{{",
    "tokenEnd": "}}",

    "elementType": "ZestVariables"
  },
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetapp.com/view?file=../../../../../etc/passwd",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "regex": "root:x:0:0",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Directory Traversal vulnerability detected in parameter 'file'",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],
      "index": 3,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **ZestRequest**:
   This defines a GET request to access a file through the parameter 'file'. The injected payload `../../../../../etc/passwd` is a common path used in directory traversal attacks to access the `/etc/passwd` file on UNIX-based systems.
    ```json
    {
      "url": "http://targetapp.com/view?file=../../../../../etc/passwd",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
    ```

2. **ZestAssertion**:
   This checks if the HTTP status code of the response is 200 (OK). If the response returns a 200 status, it means the server has successfully found and possibly served the file.
    ```json
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
    ```

3. **ZestConditionRegex**:
   This condition checks if the response body contains the string "root:x:0:0", a typical marker found in the `/etc/passwd` file. If this condition is true, it indicates that the file was accessed, suggesting a directory traversal vulnerability.
    ```json
    {
      "regex": "root:x:0:0",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Directory Traversal vulnerability detected in parameter 'file'",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],
      "index": 3,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
    ```

### Variations:
- The script can be modified to check different parameters and use various payloads like:
  - URL encoding: `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/passwd`
  - Windows-specific paths: `..\\..\\..\\..\\boot.ini`
  
### Conclusion:
These scripts use the structure and components of Zest to define requests, actions, and checks which automate the testing for Link Following vulnerabilities. For more complex scenarios, multiple requests or different failure conditions could be implemented based on application response behavior   .
