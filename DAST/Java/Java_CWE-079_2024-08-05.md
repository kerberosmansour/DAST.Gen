# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-079) in Java

#### Understanding XSS Vulnerabilities in Java Web Applications

### Overview of XSS Vulnerabilities
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. Java web applications, especially those using JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlets, and various frameworks like Spring MVC, are susceptible to XSS if input is improperly sanitized.

### Common Injection Points
Injection points where XSS vulnerabilities commonly occur include:
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

### Indicators of XSS Vulnerabilities
Typical indicators of success when detecting XSS include:
- Inclusion of payload in the HTTP response
- Execution of JavaScript alerts or script blocks added dynamically
- Changes in the DOM that include malicious scripts

## Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts
Zest is a specialized scripting language used within OWASP ZAP for automating security testing. Based on the provided documentation, the key components of Zest scripts include:

### Key Components
1. **ZestRequest**: Defines the HTTP request.
2. **ZestAction**: Manipulates requests or responses.
3. **ZestCondition**: Applies conditions to control the flow.
4. **ZestAssertion**: Verifies expected responses.

Here’s how to create Zest scripts to detect XSS in various scenarios:

### Script 1: Testing URL Parameters

```json
{
  "title": "Detect XSS in URL Parameters",
  "description": "Script to detect XSS vulnerabilities in URL parameters",
  "properties": [],
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://targetapplication.com/page?param=<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": [],
      "data": "",
      "index": 1
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestConditional",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex",
        "regex": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
        "location": "BODY"
      },
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "message": "XSS vulnerability detected in URL parameter"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Script 2: Testing HTTP Headers

```json
{
  "title": "Detect XSS in HTTP Headers",
  "description": "Script to detect XSS vulnerabilities in HTTP headers",
  "properties": [],
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://targetapplication.com/page",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert('XSS')</script>",
      "data": "",
      "index": 1
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestConditional",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex",
        "regex": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
        "location": "BODY"
      },
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "message": "XSS vulnerability detected in HTTP headers"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Script 3: Testing HTTP Request Body

```json
{
  "title": "Detect XSS in HTTP Request Body",
  "description": "Script to detect XSS vulnerabilities in HTTP request body",
  "properties": [],
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://targetapplication.com/page",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "data": "param=<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
      "index": 1
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestConditional",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex",
        "regex": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
        "location": "BODY"
      },
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "message": "XSS vulnerability detected in HTTP request body"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

## Explanation and Logic Behind the Scripts

### Design Logic
- **ZestRequest**: Each script begins with a `ZestRequest` that simulates a request with a potential XSS payload.
- **ZestConditionRegex**: This conditional checks if the malicious script is present in the HTTP response body.
- **ZestActionFail**: If the condition is met, indicating potential XSS vulnerability, this action logs a failure.

### Reasoning
These scripts aim to cover various common injection points for XSS vulnerabilities such as URL parameters, HTTP headers, and request bodies. By asserting the presence of the payload in the response body, we can detect if the application is vulnerable to XSS【4:0†source】【4:4†source】【4:7†source】.

Overall, these Zest scripts provide automated testing for XSS vulnerabilities tailored for Java web applications, addressing typical injection points and using logical assertions to detect malicious scripts in responses.
