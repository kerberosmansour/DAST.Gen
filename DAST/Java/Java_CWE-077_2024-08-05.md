# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in Java

###### Explanation of Command Injection

**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Command ('Command Injection'):**
Command Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when an application adds untrusted data to a command string that will be executed by the shell. Attackers exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. In Java web applications, this often involves the use of methods like `Runtime.exec()` or `ProcessBuilder.start()`.

### Identifying Injection Points

**Common Injection Points Include:**
- **URL Parameters:** Untrusted data included in URLs that are used to construct command strings.
- **HTTP Request Bodies:** Data passed in POST requests that are not sanitized and are directly used in command execution.
- **HTTP Headers:** Custom headers that include data used in commands.
- **Cookies:** Data stored in cookies that is used without proper validation.
- **Query Strings:** Parts of input queries that are used in command execution.

### Indicators of Successful Exploitation

**Typical Indicators Include:**
- **Output of Executed Commands:** Any response containing the results of a system command (e.g., directory listings or file content).
- **Error Messages:** System-related error messages indicating command execution failure or shell errors.
- **Response Status Codes:** Unusual status codes like 500 Internal Server Error.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts
Below, a Zest script structure is provided to detect command injection vulnerabilities. This script will simulate an attack by injecting commands into various fields and checking the response for command execution results.

### Sample Zest Script to Detect Command Injection

1. **Testing URL Parameters:**

```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.25",
  "title": "Command Injection - URL Parameter",
  "description": "Tests for command injection in URL parameters",
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://testsite.com/api?param=value;ls",
      "method": "GET",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "type": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "type": "ZestConditionRegex",
            "regex": ".*index\\.html.*"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Command Injection detected via URL parameter"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Testing POST Request Bodies:**

```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.25",
  "title": "Command Injection - POST Body",
  "description": "Tests for command injection in POST request body",
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://testsite.com/upload",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "filename=sample.txt&content=test; cat /etc/passwd",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "type": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "type": "ZestConditionRegex",
            "regex": "root:.*:0:0:.*:.*:.*"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Command Injection detected via POST body"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Testing HTTP Headers:**

```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.25",
  "title": "Command Injection - Headers",
  "description": "Tests for command injection in HTTP headers",
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://testsite.com/api",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {
        "User-Agent": "test-agent; uname -a"
      },
      "assertions": [
        {
          "type": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "type": "ZestConditionRegex",
            "regex": "Linux.*"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Command Injection detected via HTTP headers"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Testing Cookies:**

```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.25",
  "title": "Command Injection - Cookies",
  "description": "Tests for command injection in cookies",
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://testsite.com/dashboard",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {
        "Cookie": "sessionid=abc123; id > /tmp/testfile"
      },
      "assertions": [
        {
          "type": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "type": "ZestConditionRegex",
            "regex": "testfile.*"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Command Injection detected via cookies"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Zest Script Structure:**

- **ZestRequest:** Represents the HTTP request to be sent.
- **ZestAssertion:** Used to check if the HTTP response contains conditions indicative of command injection.
- **ZestActionFail:** Triggers script failure if an assertion passes, indicating the presence of a vulnerability.

### Detailed Design Explanation:
- **URL Parameters:** The script appends a simple command ('ls') to a URL parameter and validates if a file list is returned.
- **POST Body:** Injects a command in the POST request body to check if sensitive file content is exposed.
- **HTTP Headers:** Manipulates the `User-Agent` header to include a shell command and verify if the system information is disclosed.
- **Cookies:** Adds a command to the cookie to see if a new test file is created.

This approach checks multiple common injection points and uses assertions to specifically look for command execution results in responses, minimizing false positives and false negatives by precisely validating successful command execution indicators.
