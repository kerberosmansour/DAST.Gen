# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in Java

###### Explanation of Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

**Overview:**
OS Command Injection vulnerabilities occur when an application constructs and executes shell commands directly from user input. An attacker can manipulate this input to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. This vulnerability can lead to significant security breaches, including unauthorized data access, data corruption, and complete system compromise.

**Manifestation in Java Applications:**
In Java-based web applications, OS command injection vulnerabilities often arise when user-supplied data is passed directly to system-level commands using methods such as `Runtime.exec()`. Popular Java frameworks like Spring and Struts can also inadvertently expose applications to these risks if not properly secured.

**Common Injection Points:**
1. **URL Parameters:** Directly passing user input from URL parameters to command execution.
2. **HTTP Request Bodies:** Including user inputs within POST data which are then used in command execution.
3. **HTTP Headers:** Utilizing header values without proper sanitizations, such as User-Agent or Cookie values.
4. **Cookies:** Using cookie values directly in commands.
5. **Query Strings:** User input in query strings being appended to commands.

### Indicators of Success:
Typical indicators that an OS command injection has succeeded include:
- **Error messages** revealing execution details or system specifics (e.g., output of commands).
- **HTTP Response Codes** that deviate from normal behaviors.
- **Response Content** that includes unexpected or attacker-introduced data.

### Explanation of Script Design

1. **ZestRequest:**
   - Constructs HTTP requests, including necessary headers, URLs, and data.
2. **ZestConditionRegex:**
   - Checks responses for patterns indicating successful command execution.
3. **ZestActionFail:**
   - Triggers if the condition (presence of command execution output) is met.
   
### Minimizing False Positives/Negatives
- **Comprehensive Injection Patterns:** Scripts deploy varied patterns typical for OS injection.
- **Targeted Regex Conditions:** Assertions look for definitive proof of injection success, like directory listings or sensitive file dumps.

### Conclusion
Using the scripts effectively demands understanding injection points and studying server responses. Combining multiple scripts improves detection reliability, covering different vectors and formats.
