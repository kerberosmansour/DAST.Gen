# Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in Java

###### Explanation of Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** vulnerabilities occur when a web application does not impose restrictions on the allocation of key resources such as memory, CPU, threads, file handles, etc. Attackers can exploit this by excessively consuming resources, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, where legitimate users are unable to access the service due to resource exhaustion.

#### How it Manifests in Java Web Applications

In Java web applications, this vulnerability can manifest in various ways including:
- **Excessive Memory Usage**: Accepting large data uploads or unbounded data input.
- **Thread Flooding**: Opening many concurrent connections without limits.
- **Unbounded Request Parameters**: Accepting large or infinite query parameters.
- **Log File Growth**: Writing excessive amounts of data to log files.

Popular frameworks such as Spring and Apache Struts are often targeted, and misuse of certain libraries can exacerbate these vulnerabilities.

#### Common Injection Points
- **URL Parameters**
- **HTTP Request Bodies**
- **HTTP Headers**
- **Cookies**
- **Query Strings**

### OWASP ZAP Zest Scripting Concepts

**Zest** is a specialized scripting language used with OWASP ZAP. It includes components such as `ZestRequest`, `ZestAction`, `ZestAssertion`, and `ZestExpression`.

- **`ZestRequest`**: Manages HTTP requests within the script.
- **`ZestAction`**: Performs actions based on conditions or manipulates responses.
- **`ZestAssertion`**: Asserts conditions to verify expected outcomes.
- **`ZestExpression`**: Evaluates conditions and controls flow.

### Sample Zest Scripts to Detect Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Excessive Memory Usage via Large POST Body

**Logic**: This script sends a large POST request and checks if the response time exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential resource overuse.

```json
{
  "about": "Detecting excessive memory usage",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Excessive Memory Usage Detection",
  "description": "Sends a large POST request to detect unbounded memory allocation.",
  "prefix": "http://example-app.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example-app.com/upload",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "a".repeat(1024*1024*10), // 10MB data
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "response": { "statusCode": 200 },
      "assertions": [
        { 
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 200, 
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          } 
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "timeMillis": 3000, // Time in milliseconds
      "not": false,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionResponseTime",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential excessive memory usage detected!",
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

#### 2. Thread Flooding via Concurrent Requests

**Logic**: The script opens multiple concurrent connections to flood the server and observes the server’s response time or crashes to detect potential unbounded thread allocation.

```json
{
  "about": "Detecting thread flooding",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Thread Flooding Detection",
  "description": "Opens concurrent connections to identify unbounded thread allocation.",
  "prefix": "http://example-app.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example-app.com/resource",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 200,
            "not": false,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          }
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "loopCondition": {
        "expression": {
          "variableName": "i",
          "value": 100, // Number of concurrent requests
          "elementType": "ZestExpressionInteger"
        },
        "elementType": "ZestConditionLoop"
      },
      "loopIndex": "i",
      "loopObject": {
        "url": "http://example-app.com/resource",
        "method": "GET",
        "headers": "",
        "elementType": "ZestRequest"
      },
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestControlLoop"
    },
    {
      "timeMillis": 5000, // Time in milliseconds
      "not": false,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionResponseTime",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential thread flooding vulnerability detected!",
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Indicators of Success

1. **Response Time**:
   - High response time can indicate server struggle due to resource overuse.
   
2. **HTTP Status Codes**:
   - Specific codes such as `500 Internal Server Error` or `503 Service Unavailable` indicate resource exhaustion.

3. **Response Content**:
   - Custom error messages indicating resource limits or DoS protection mechanisms.

### Conclusion

Creating reliable ZAP Zest scripts for detecting Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerabilities involves simulating scenarios that stress test the application resources and checking for indicative signs of resource exhaustion. Proper assertions and conditions help in minimizing false positives and false negatives.
