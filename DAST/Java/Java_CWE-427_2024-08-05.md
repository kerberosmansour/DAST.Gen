# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in Java

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Search Path Element Vulnerabilities

**Uncontrolled Search Path Element** vulnerabilities arise when external input is used in constructing paths for executable files to be loaded. This can be exploited by attackers to load malicious executables. In Java web applications, this may appear in native library loading mechanisms, classloading functions, and several other contexts where external paths are involved.

#### Java Context:
- **Native Libraries**: `System.load()`, `System.loadLibrary()`
- **Classloading**: Using `URLClassLoader`, modifying `java.library.path` or other system properties.

### Common Injection Points
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

### Typical Responses Signifying Vulnerability
- Error messages with file path details
- 404 statuses with specific file paths
- Responses containing execution or file load errors

### Zest Scripting for OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP's Zest scripting language provides constructs like `ZestRequest`, `ZestAssertion`, `ZestAction`, and `ZestExpression` to automate attack simulations. Key actions include HTTP requests, condition evaluations, and assertions on responses.

#### Components:
1. **ZestRequest**: Define and send HTTP requests.
2. **ZestAction**: Perform actions like scanning, failing scripts based on conditions.
3. **ZestAssertion**: Verify conditions in HTTP responses (e.g., status codes, body content).
4. **ZestExpression**: Logical expressions for flow control.

### 1. Detecting via URL Parameters

#### Script to Check Uncontrolled Search Path via URL Parameter
```json
{
  "title": "Detect Uncontrolled Search Path Element via URL Parameter",
  "description": "Testing uncontrolled path in URL parameters",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "http://example.com/load?path=../../../etc/passwd",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
            "code": 200
          }
        },
        {
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
            "code": 404
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Potential uncontrolled path element detected in URL parameter"
    }
  ]
}
```
### 2. Detecting via HTTP Request Body

```json
{
  "title": "Detect Uncontrolled Search Path Element via Request Body",
  "description": "Testing uncontrolled path in request body",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "http://example.com/upload",
      "data": "path=../../../etc/passwd",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
            "code": 200,
            "not": false
          }
        },
        {
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
          "rootExpression": {
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
            "code": 404,
            "not": true
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Potential uncontrolled path element detected in request body"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Script Explanations
- **HTTP Method:** GET / POST to interact with the application.
- **URL:** Points to different potential vulnerable spots.
- **Assertions:** Check HTTP response codes to see if paths are accessed or rejected appropriately. The `ZestAssertion` looks for expected status codes that suggest potential openings for path traversal.
- **Fail Actions:** Use `ZestActionFail` to flag vulnerable behaviors.

The scripts address common variations and injection points. These Zest scripts assert conditions most likely to reveal uncontrolled search path element vulnerabilities by looking for characteristic responses from the server.

By employing these scripts in ZAP, security engineers can automate and refine the detection of potential uncontrolled search path elements while minimizing false positives and negatives based on clearly defined conditions and assertions.
