# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in Java

###### Understanding and Basics of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

#### What is CSRF?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) occurs when an attacker tricks a user’s browser into performing an unwanted action on a different site where the user is authenticated. This can result in unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of the user, such as changing account details, making transactions, or even altering permission settings.

#### How CSRF Manifests in Java Web Applications
In Java web applications, CSRF vulnerabilities often occur due to the lack of anti-CSRF tokens in forms and sensitive requests. Java frameworks like Spring MVC, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and Java Servlets can be particularly susceptible if not properly configured for security.

#### Common Injection Points for CSRF:
1. URL Parameters
2. HTTP Request Bodies
3. HTTP Headers
4. Cookies
5. Query Strings

Endpoints handling state-changing operations (like POST, PUT, DELETE) should be scrutinized for the use of CSRF tokens.

### Indicators of CSRF Vulnerability
Typical indicators include:
1. Missing CSRF tokens in sensitive requests.
2. Uniformly successful requests without CSRF tokens.
3. Specific status codes indicating success in scenarios that should fail without proper tokens (e.g., HTTP 200 surrounded by malicious activity patterns).

### Writing ZAP Zest Scripts to Detect CSRF

To automate CSRF detection using OWASP ZAP Zest scripts, we need to:
- Simulate common CSRF attack vectors in ZestRequest objects.
- Verify the presence or absence of proper CSRF tokens.
- Assess the responses using ZestAssertion and ZestExpression objects to confirm vulnerabilities.

#### Example Zest Script to Detect CSRF:

```json
{
  "zestScript": {
    "title": "CSRF Detection Script",
    "description": "Detects the absence of CSRF tokens in state-changing requests",
    "requests": [
      {
        "elementType": "ZestRequest",
        "url": "http://example.com/account/change",
        "method": "POST",
        "data": "new_username=hacker",
        "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        "index": 0
      }
    ],
    "actions": [
      {
        "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
        "message": "Potential CSRF vulnerability detected due to lack of CSRF token",
        "index": 1
      }
    ],
    "assertions": [
      {
        "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
        "rootExpression": {
          "not": false,
          "code": 200,
          "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
        },
        "index": 2
      },
      {
        "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
        "rootExpression": {
          "not": true,
          "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex",
          "regex": "csrf_token=.*",
          "location": "REQUEST"
        },
        "index": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation
#### Simulation (ZestRequest)
- Simulate a state-changing request (e.g., changing a username) via a POST request.
- Fill in endpoint URL and respective data as per the application scenario.

#### Logic Application (ZestAction)
- Trigger an action that fails the script if a CSRF token is not present, indicating potential vulnerability.

#### Assertions (ZestAssertion)
- Check for successful response status code (200 OK) indicating state change.
- Validate the absence or presence of the `csrf_token` in the request to confirm its secure handling.

This script minimizes false positives by explicitly checking for absence (`"not": true`) of the `csrf_token` in the request leading to successful unwanted state change.

### Conclusion
To ensure robust detection:
- Customize injection points based on specific application flows.
- Iterate assertions to cover various HTTP methods and endpoints.
- Regularly update and validate the scripts against confirmed vulnerabilities and application changes.

Proper implementation of these Zest scripts will streamline the detection of CSRF vulnerabilities in Java web applications, ensuring enhanced security posture【4:0†source】.
