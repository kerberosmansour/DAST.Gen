# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in Java

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

**SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Java Web Applications**

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that can destroy your database. It is one of the most common web hacking techniques. This flaw occurs when a web application allows users to submit input that is directly included in a SQL query, without properly validating or escaping that input. It can lead to unauthorized access to view, modify, or delete data within a database, execute administrative operations, and sometimes even lead to full server control.

**Typical Manifestations in Java Web Applications:**

1. **Dynamic Query Construction**: This occurs when SQL queries are built dynamically, using user input without proper sanitization.
2. **Framework Vulnerabilities**: Frameworks like JSP, Servlets, or even more modern ones like Spring can have vulnerabilities if queries are improperly constructed.
3. **ORM Risks**: Improper use of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools such as Hibernate may also lead to SQL injection.

**Common Injection Points**:
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

### Creating OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for SQL Injection Detection

**1. Simulating SQL Injection Attack (Zest script for URL parameter):**

```json
{
  "about": "Zest script to detect SQL Injection via URL parameter",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "SQL Injection Detection - URL Parameter",
  "description": "Script to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities by injecting into URL parameters.",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/page?id=1' OR '1'='1",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
        "code": 200,
        "not": false
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "Internal Server Error|Syntax error|Unclosed quotation mark",
        "location": "BODY",
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
      }
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

**2. Simulating SQL Injection Attack (Zest script for HTTP request body):**

```json
{
  "about": "Zest script to detect SQL Injection via HTTP POST body",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "SQL Injection Detection - POST Body",
  "description": "Script to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities by injecting into HTTP POST body.",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/formsubmit",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "username=admin' OR '1'='1&password=test",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
        "code": 200,
        "not": false
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "Internal Server Error|Syntax error|Unclosed quotation mark",
        "location": "BODY",
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
      }
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

**3. Simulating SQL Injection Attack (Zest script for HTTP headers):**

```json
{
  "about": "Zest script to detect SQL Injection via HTTP headers",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "SQL Injection Detection - HTTP Headers",
  "description": "Script to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities by injecting into HTTP headers.",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/page",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' OR '1'='1",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
        "code": 200,
        "not": false
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "Internal Server Error|Syntax error|Unclosed quotation mark",
        "location": "BODY",
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
      }
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Explanation:

Each script demonstrates a different variation of SQL Injection, focusing on various injection points. The key components include:

1. **ZestRequest**: This is used to define HTTP requests with potential SQL injection payloads injected.
2. **ZestAssertion**: Used to verify the presence of SQL injection by checking response status codes and searching for typical SQL error messages. Assertions help in detecting valid vulnerabilities by looking for known indicators such as errors or anomalies resulting from the injection attempts.
3. **ZestExpression**: Utilized within assertions to validate specific conditions in the response, such as regex patterns detecting SQL errors.

**Injection Points Addressed**: The scripts address common injection points like URL parameters, POST request bodies, and HTTP headers.

**Indicators of Success**: Each script includes assertions checking HTTP status codes and regex patterns indicative of SQL errors, ensuring both types of validation are covered to improve accuracy.

**Minimizing False Positives/Negatives**: By combining status code checks with regex-based assertions for common SQL error patterns, these scripts aim to accurately identify the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities, reducing the likelihood of false positives or negatives.

By following these structured scripts, application security engineers can effectively automate the detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java web applications using OWASP ZAP.
