# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in Java

###### Understanding Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

**Description:**
Improper Control of Generation of Code, colloquially known as Code Injection, occurs when an application generates and executes code based on user inputs without proper validation or sanitization. In Java web applications, this could involve:
- Embedding user input into dynamically generated Java code.
- Executing shell commands using user inputs via Java's `Runtime.exec()` or similar methods.
- Manipulating Java Reflection API dynamically using user inputs.

**Impacts:**
- Unauthorized code execution
- Potential for full system compromise
- Data theft and manipulation
- Denial of service attacks

**Common Injection Points:**
In Java web applications, typical injection points can include:
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

### Creating OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

**Key Zest Components:**
- **ZestRequest**: Represents the request made to the web server.
- **ZestAssertion**: Checks applied to the responses to ensure they meet certain criteria.
- **ZestAction**: Defines actions to be taken during script execution.
- **ZestExpression**: Provides logic and control flows, like conditionals.

### Sample Zest Scripts for Code Injection in Java Web Applications

#### Script 1: Testing URL Parameters

```json
{
  "title": "Test Code Injection via URL Parameters",
  "description": "This Zest script tests for code injection vulnerabilities via URL parameters in a Java web app.",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetwebsite.com/test?input=<script>alert(1)</script>",
      "method": "GET",
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "<script>alert(1)</script>",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- This script sends a request with a potential code injection payload as a URL parameter.
- The `ZestAssertion` checks if the response contains the payload, indicating that it was executed or reflected back, which is a sign of a code injection vulnerability.

#### Script 2: Testing HTTP Request Bodies

```json
{
  "title": "Test Code Injection via Request Bodies",
  "description": "This script tests for code injection vulnerabilities via HTTP request bodies in a Java web app.",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetwebsite.com/submit",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "input=<script>alert(1)</script>",
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "<script>alert(1)</script>",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- This script sends a POST request with a payload in the request body.
- The `ZestAssertion` checks the response body for the payload to identify code injection vulnerability.

#### Script 3: Testing HTTP Headers

```json
{
  "title": "Test Code Injection via HTTP Headers",
  "description": "This Zest script tests for code injection vulnerabilities via custom HTTP headers in a Java web app.",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetwebsite.com/test",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {
        "X-Test-Header": "<script>alert(1)</script>"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "<script>alert(1)</script>",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Sends a GET request with a potential code injection payload in a custom header.
- Checks if the response body contains the payload as an indication of a vulnerability.

#### Script 4: Testing Query Strings

```json
{
  "title": "Test Code Injection via Query Strings",
  "description": "This script tests for code injection vulnerabilities through query strings in a Java web app.",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetwebsite.com/test?query=<script>alert(1)</script>",
      "method": "GET",
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "<script>alert(1)</script>",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Tests if query strings are vulnerable to code injection by sending a GET request with an injection payload in the query string.
- The response is checked to see if the payload executes or is reflected back.

### Conclusion

These scripts offer a starting point for detecting Code Injection vulnerabilities in Java web applications using OWASP ZAP and Zest scripting. The key to accurate detection is carefully crafting the payloads for different injection points and thoroughly validating the responses to differentiate between actual vulnerabilities and benign behavior【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:7†source】【4:17†source】【4:19†source】.
