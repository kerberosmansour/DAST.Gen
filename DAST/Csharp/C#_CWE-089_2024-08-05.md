# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-089) in C#

###### Understanding SQL Injection in C#

**1. Overview of SQL Injection:**
SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability through which attackers can manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code into the input fields of a web application. This can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and data manipulation.

**2. Common Injection Points in C# Web Applications:**
- URL Parameters: e.g., `http://example.com/page?id=1`
- Form Inputs: e.g., search fields, login forms, etc.
- HTTP Headers: e.g., User-Agent, Referer, etc.
- Cookies: values stored in HTTP cookies.

**3. Variations of SQL Injection:**
- **Error-Based SQLi:** Exploiting error messages to gather information.
- **Union-Based SQLi:** Leveraging the UNION SQL operator to inject payloads for retrieving data.
- **Boolean-Based Blind SQLi:** Inferring data from the behavior (true or false) of the application.
- **Time-Based Blind SQLi:** Inferring data based on the time the application takes to respond.

**4. Indicators of a Successful Attack:**
- SQL errors indicating database schema information.
- Changes in the response content or structure.
- Delays in response times indicating time-based payloads.

### OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for SQL Injection Detection

**1. Error-Based SQL Injection Detection Script:**

```json
{
  "title": "Error-Based SQL Injection Test",
  "description": "Detects potential SQL errors in responses",
  "prefix": "http://targetsite.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/page?id=1'",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "SQL syntax.*MySQL|Warning.*mssql|ORA-00933.*Oracle",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "SQL Injection vulnerability detected based on error messages.",
          "index": 1,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Sends a request to a URL with a common SQL injection payload (`1'`).
- Uses regular expressions to detect common SQL error messages in the response body.
- If an error message is found, it triggers a fail action indicating a possible SQL Injection vulnerability.

**2. Union-Based SQL Injection Detection Script:**

```json
{
  "title": "Union-Based SQL Injection Test",
  "description": "Detects SQL Injection using UNION operator",
  "prefix": "http://targetsite.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/page?id=1 UNION SELECT NULL",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "NULL",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "SQL Injection vulnerability detected using UNION SELECT.",
          "index": 1,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Sends a request using the UNION operator to concatenate malicious queries to the existing query.
- Checks for the string "NULL" in the response, indicating that the injected query was executed.

**3. Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection Detection Script:**

```json
{
  "title": "Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection Test",
  "description": "Detects SQL Injection by observing changes in response behavior",
  "prefix": "http://targetsite.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/page?id=1 AND 1=1",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/page?id=1 AND 1=2",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "No results found",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential Boolean-Based Blind SQL injection.",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Sends two requests: one with a condition that is always true (`1=1`) and one that is always false (`1=2`).
- Checks if the response differs, which indicates that the SQL condition is being evaluated, suggesting vulnerability.

**4. Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Detection Script:**

```json
{
  "title": "Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Test",
  "description": "Detects SQL Injection by observing time delays",
  "prefix": "http://targetsite.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/page?id=1; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "greaterThanMillis": 10000,
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionTime",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential Time-Based Blind SQL Injection.",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses a SQL payload to introduce a deliberate time delay (`WAITFOR DELAY`).
- Checks if the response time exceeds the expected delay, indicating that the payload was executed and the application is vulnerable.

### Summary
These Zest scripts facilitate detecting various forms of SQL injection in C# web applications by employing different payloads and verification methods as outlined above. Proper implementation and configuration are necessary to minimize false positives and false negatives, ensuring reliable detection accuracy【4:0†source】.
