# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in C#

###### Explanation of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
CSRF is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious actor tricks a user into performing actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. The user unwittingly sends requests to the application with their existing authentication context. Typically, this involves sending forged requests with parameters that perform privileged actions, such as changing account details or conducting transactions, without the user's consent.

#### How CSRF Works:
1. **Victim Authentication**: The user authenticates on a trusted site, e.g., `trustedbank.com`.
2. **Malicious Link**: The attacker crafts a malicious link or form and sends it to the victim.
3. **User Interaction**: The user clicks on the link or interacts with the form.
4. **Action Execution**: The browser automatically includes the user's session cookies or authentication tokens when submitting the request to `trustedbank.com`.

If `trustedbank.com` does not verify the origin of the request, it will process the request, believing it to be legitimate.

### Common Injection Points for CSRF
1. **URL Parameters**: Forged requests can be sent through crafted URLs.
2. **HTTP Request Bodies**: POST request bodies manipulated through hidden forms.
3. **HTTP Headers**: Custom headers can sometimes be exploited if the application uses them for state-changing operations.

### Indicators of Successful Detection
Typical signs of CSRF vulnerabilities include:
- **Lack of Anti-CSRF Tokens**: No unique tokens in forms validated on submission.
- **Non-Same-Origin Requests**: The ability to perform sensitive actions via GET or POST requests from a different origin.
- **Error Messages**: Specific error messages indicating failed authentication or state changes.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for CSRF Detection

**Zest Script Example for CSRF Detection**: The following Zest script will test the presence of CSRF tokens on a form submission endpoint. This will try submitting a form without a CSRF token and check if the application permits it.

#### Zest Script for Detecting Missing CSRF Token in POST Requests

```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Detect missing CSRF protection on POST requests",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/login",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "tokenName": "csrf",
      "prefix": "name=\"csrf\" value=\"",
      "postfix": "\"",
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestActionSetToken"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/vulnerable_form",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "param1=value1&param2=value2",
      "index": 3,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200, // Or the expected code when missing CSRF
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "index": 4,
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "message": "CSRF vulnerability detected: No CSRF token in the request",
      "index": 5,
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Zest Version & Metadata**: Basic metadata to define the script version and title.
2. **Request to Login Page**: Fetch the page where the CSRF token is usually provided (e.g., login page).
3. **Extract CSRF Token**: Use `ZestActionSetToken` to set the CSRF token from the response.
4. **Submit Form Without Token**: Make a POST request to the vulnerable form endpoint without including the CSRF token.
5. **Assertion**: Check if a 200 status code is returned which may indicate the form submission was successful without CSRF protection.
6. **Failure Action**: If the assertion is true, log the vulnerability.

### Documentation and Explanation
1. **Identify CSRF Manifestations**:
   - Absence of unique anti-CSRF tokens.
   - State-changing operations via GET requests.
   - Accepting requests from different origins without validation.

2. **Common Indicators**:
   - Expected responses based on application behavior: redirections, success, or error codes.
   - Error messages after attempts to execute requests without tokens.

### Conclusion
To identify and mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities, it is crucial to ensure the presence and validation of anti-CSRF tokens, restrict state-changing operations to POST requests, and validate the origin of requests. Zest scripting in OWASP ZAP can be effectively employed to automate these tests and improve application security.
