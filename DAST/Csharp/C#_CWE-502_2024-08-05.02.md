# Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) in C#

###### Understanding Deserialization of Untrusted Data:

**What is Deserialization of Untrusted Data?**

Deserialization of untrusted data refers to the process where serialized data from an untrusted source is deserialized without proper validation or handling. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as remote code execution, data tampering, and other unauthorized operations.

### How Deserialization Vulnerabilities Manifest in C# Web Applications:

1. **BinaryFormatter**: One of the most common sources of deserialization issues in C# applications is the `BinaryFormatter` class. If an attacker can control the data being deserialized by this class, it can result in remote code execution.

2. **JSON.NET**: Improper use of JSON deserialization, especially when using default settings that do not restrict object creation or type resolution, can also be a source of vulnerabilities.

3. **XML Deserialization**: Unsafe deserialization when using `XmlSerializer` or `DataContractSerializer` without proper controls can lead to injection attacks.

### Typical Injection Points:

1. **URL Parameters**: When serialized data is passed as part of the URL.
2. **HTTP Request Body**: When the serialized data is part of the request payload.
3. **HTTP Headers**: Malicious data can also be injected through HTTP headers.
4. **Cookies**: Serialized data stored in cookies can be manipulated by attackers.
5. **WebSocket Messages**: Real-time applications using WebSocket may accept serialized data.

### Indicators of Deserialization Vulnerabilities:

1. **Unexpected Exceptions**: Application throws unexpected exceptions during the deserialization process.
2. **Changed Application Behavior**: Unusual behavior of the application when certain inputs are deserialized.
3. **Execution of Unauthorized Commands**: If there is a capability for remote command execution through deserialized data.
4. **Security Alerts**: Identification of known vulnerable patterns like the use of `BinaryFormatter`.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for Detecting Deserialization Vulnerabilities:

**Example 1: Detecting Binary Deserialization Vulnerability**

```json
{
  "about": "Zest script to detect BinaryFormatter deserialization vulnerability",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "generatedBy": "ZAP",
  "title": "BinaryFormatter Deserialization Detection",
  "description": "Detects potential deserialization issues with BinaryFormatter in C# applications",
  "prefix": "http://target-application",
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://target-application/test",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "base64_encoded_payload",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/octet-stream",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 500,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "index": 1
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex",
      "regex": "Invalid cast from 'System.String' to 'System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity'",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "message": "Possible BinaryFormatter deserialization vulnerability detected",
          "index": 2
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],
      "index": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Request**: Sends a POST request with a sample payload to a test endpoint.
2. **Assertion**: Checks if the response status code is `500`.
3. **Conditional**: Evaluates the response body for specific exceptions commonly associated with deserialization issues (e.g., Invalid cast exception).
4. **Action**: Fails the script if the conditional is met, indicating a potential vulnerability.

**Example 2: Detecting JSON.NET Deserialization Vulnerability**

```json
{
  "about": "Zest script to detect JSON.NET deserialization vulnerability",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "generatedBy": "ZAP",
  "title": "JSON.NET Deserialization Detection",
  "description": "Detects potential deserialization issues with JSON.NET in C# applications",
  "prefix": "http://target-application",
  "statements": [
    {
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://target-application/api/test",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "{\"$type\":\"SomeClass, SomeAssembly\",\"Property\":\"payload\"}",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/json",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 500,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "index": 1
    },
    {
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex",
      "regex": "Could not create an instance of type",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "message": "Possible JSON.NET deserialization vulnerability detected",
          "index": 2
        }
      ],
      "elseStatements": [],
      "index": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Request**: Sends a POST request to a test endpoint with a potentially malicious payload targeting JSON.NET deserialization.
2. **Assertion**: Checks if the response status code is `500`.
3. **Conditional**: Examines the response body for error messages related to JSON.NET deserialization issues.
4. **Action**: Fails the script if the conditional is met, indicating a potential vulnerability.

These Zest scripts help automate the detection of deserialization vulnerabilities by sending controlled payloads and analyzing response patterns and error messages【4:0†source】  .

Each script needs to be carefully tailored and validated against the specific application being tested to ensure accuracy and reduce false positives and negatives. The key is to simulate realistic attack scenarios and look for indicative responses that signify a vulnerability.
