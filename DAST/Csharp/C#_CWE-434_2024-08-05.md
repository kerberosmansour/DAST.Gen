# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in C#

###### Understanding Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

#### Nature of the Vulnerability
The Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability occurs when an application fails to adequately validate or restrict the types of files that users can upload. In C# web applications, this often manifests when the server-side code does not enforce strict checks on the file type and contents, allowing attackers to upload malicious files such as scripts, executables, or other types of files that could be harmful when processed by the application.

#### Common Manifestations in C#
In common C# web frameworks like ASP.NET, the following scenarios can lead to this vulnerability:
- Using file upload controls without validating file extensions or MIME types.
- Storing uploaded files in directories accessible by the web server without sanitizing file names or paths.
- Code that processes or executes the contents of uploaded files (e.g., evaluating image contents, processing scripts).

### Variations and Common Injection Points
Different variations of this vulnerability can occur depending on where and how the file upload feature is implemented:
- **File Name Validation:** Failing to check file names that may include escape characters to manipulate the filesystem.
- **MIME Type Validation:** Relying solely on client-sent MIME types which can easily be forged.
- **File Content Sniffing:** Only inspecting the initial bytes of the file to determine the type which might be ineffective against certain types of malicious files.
- **Upload Directory Access:** Storing files in accessible directories allowing direct execution or download.

Common injection points include:
- **HTTP POST Requests:** Especially in form data including "multipart/form-data" encoded data.
- **API Endpoints Accepting File Uploads:** Where files are sent as part of a request body.
- **URL Parameters:** Some lesser-known attacks may involve embedding file references in URL parameters.

### Indicators of Success
Indicators that reveal the presence of this vulnerability include:
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Successful uploads typically return HTTP status code 200.
- **Response Body Patterns:** Look for HTML elements or specific messages indicating successful uploads.
- **File Access Tests:** Directly accessing the uploaded file URL to confirm its presence and behavior.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts to Detect Vulnerabilities

#### Sample Zest Script for File Name Validation
```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "File Upload with Dangerous Filename",
  "description": "Detects if the application allows dangerous file names during upload",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/upload",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "------WebKitFormBoundary\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"dangerous.php\"\r\nContent-Type: application/x-php\r\n\r\n<?php echo 'hello'; ?>---\r\n",
      "headers": "Content-Type: multipart/form-data",
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "message": "Unhandled file type uploaded successfully.",
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```
This script sends a POST request to upload a file named "dangerous.php" and checks if the response status code is 200, indicating a potentially successful vulnerability exploitation.

#### Sample Zest Script for MIME Type Validation
```json
{
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "File Upload with Dangerous MIME Type",
  "description": "Detects if the application allows dangerous MIME types during upload",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/upload",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "------WebKitFormBoundary\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"image.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: application/x-php\r\n\r\n<?php echo 'hello'; ?>---\r\n",
      "headers": "Content-Type: multipart/form-data",
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "message": "Unhandled MIME type uploaded successfully.",
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```
This script tests whether the application accepts a PHP script disguised as a JPEG image by confusing the MIME type validation.

### Documentation and Explanation

#### Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
This vulnerability can be exploited in several ways. An attacker could gain code execution on the server by uploading a PHP file that gets executed or by uploading a shell script. These files can contain malicious payloads that might result in data corruption, data theft, or further system compromises. Avoiding this requires rigorous validation of file names, types, content checks, and secure storage practices.

#### How Each Zest Script Works
- **File Name Validation Script:** 
  - The script sends a file with a PHP extension to the server upload endpoint and checks the status code.
  - If the status code is 200, it assumes the upload has succeeded and triggers a failure action.

- **MIME Type Validation Script:**
  - This script uploads a file with an incongruent MIME type (PHP script with a JPEG extension).
  - Similar to the previous example, it checks for a status code of 200 and if found, proceeds to trigger a failure action illustrating the vulnerability presence.

#### Ensuring Accuracy
To ensure these scripts accurately detect the vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives and negatives:
- **Use realistic filenames/content that resemble common exploit attempts.**
- **Employ comprehensive response checks for both status codes and specific success messages/content.**
