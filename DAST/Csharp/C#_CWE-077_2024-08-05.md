# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in C#

#### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')

**What is Command Injection?**

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') occurs when an application constructs all or part of a command in an unsafe manner. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server. Command injection can lead to unauthorized actions, data exposure, or even complete server compromise.

**How it Manifests in C# Web Applications:**

In C# web applications, especially when using popular frameworks such as ASP.NET, Web Forms, or ASP.NET MVC, command injection may occur when user input is included in commands executed by the system. This can arise from inappropriate usage of APIs like `Process.Start`, where unsanitized input is passed.

### Variations and Common Injection Points:

1. **URL Parameters:**
   - Command injection can occur when parameters in the URL are directly incorporated into command-line executions.
   
2. **HTTP Headers:**
   - Attackers can inject commands by manipulating HTTP headers, which may be used in command execution.
   
3. **HTTP Request Body:**
   - Data passed through POST requests can also be a vector if used directly in command line executions.

4. **Form Inputs:**
   - Inputs from web forms when concatenated directly to command strings.

### Indicators of Success:

To detect successful command injection, one can look for unusual system behavior or specific responses, such as:
- Presence of command response content in the HTTP response body.
- Errors that indicate command execution results (e.g., file not found errors).
- Side effects such as file creation or deletion.

```

### Documenting the Zest Scripts

**Explanation of Detection Strategy:**

1. **Detecting Command Injection via URL Parameter:**
   - **Request Construction:** The script constructs a URL where a parameter includes a command injection payload (`foobar;echo InjectedCmd`).
   - **Response Checking:** It checks if the response body contains the command execution result (`InjectedCmd`), indicating a vulnerability.

2. **Detecting Command Injection via HTTP Header:**
   - **Request Construction:** The script adds an HTTP header with a command injection payload (`X-Injected-Header: foobar;echo InjectedHeaderCmd`).
   - **Response Checking:** It verifies the presence of the command execution result (`InjectedHeaderCmd`) in the response.

3. **Detecting Command Injection via POST Request Body:**
   - **Request Construction:** Forms a POST request where a body parameter includes a command injection payload (`param=foobar;echo InjectedPostCmd`).
   - **Response Checking:** Checks the response for the command execution result (`InjectedPostCmd`), denoting a vulnerability.
