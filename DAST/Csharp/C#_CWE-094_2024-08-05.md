# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in C#

###### Understanding Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

**1. Overview:**
Improper Control of Generation of Code, commonly known as Code Injection, occurs when an attacker can insert and execute arbitrary code within a program. In C# web applications, this usually happens when user-controlled input is processed and directly compiled or executed. Such vulnerabilities pose significant security risks as they can lead to remote code execution or other critical impacts.

**2. Typical Manifestations in C# Web Applications:**
In C#, Code Injection can manifest in several ways including:
- Dynamic code evaluation (`CSharpCodeProvider`, `Roslyn`).
- Invocation of unmanaged code via P/Invoke.
- Dynamically compiled code snippets using `Assembly.Load` or `Assembly.LoadFrom`.

**3. Common Injection Points:**
- **URL Parameters:** Input directly from the URL.
- **Form Data:** Data submitted via HTTP POST requests.
- **HTTP Headers:** Custom headers manipulated by the user.
- **Cookies:** Data stored on the client-side and sent with HTTP requests.

**4. Indicators of Code Injection:**
Typical indicators of successful Code Injection include:
- Unusual error messages referencing code contexts.
- Presence of arbitrary code or output within the HTTP response.
- Changes in application behavior, or execution of unexpected commands.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

To identify Code Injection vulnerabilities in C#, we create Zest scripts targeting each type of injection point. Below are examples of Zest scripts for different scenarios.

**Script 1: URL Parameter Injection Testing**

- **Request with potential malicious code in URL parameter.**
- **Check for error messages or unexpected output.**

```json
{
  "title": "Code Injection via URL Parameter",
  "prefix": "http://localhost:8080",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/example?input=<%25=Runtime.getRuntime().exec('calc')%25>",
      "method": "GET",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "Application Error|Syntax Error|Execution failed",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential Code Injection Vulnerability detected in URL Parameter",
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "index": 3
        }
      ],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```
**Explanation:**
- This script sends a GET request to an endpoint with a potentially malicious URL parameter.
- It checks the response body for common error messages that suggest execution of injected code and fails if any match is found.

**Script 2: Form Data Injection Testing**

- **POST request with malicious payload in form data.**
- **Check for abnormal errors or behavior in the response.**

```json
{
  "title": "Code Injection via Form Data",
  "prefix": "http://localhost:8080",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/login",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "username=<%25=Runtime.getRuntime().exec('calc')%25>&password=password",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "Application Error|Syntax Error|Execution failed",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential Code Injection Vulnerability detected in Form Data",
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "index": 3
        }
      ],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```
**Explanation:**
- This script executes a POST request with form data containing code that attempts to execute a command.
- It uses regex conditionals to detect common indicators of code injection in the form of error messages or abnormal output.

**Script 3: HTTP Header Injection Testing**

- **Send request with injected code in HTTP headers.**
- **Check for any discrepancies in the response that could indicate execution.**

```json
{
  "title": "Code Injection via HTTP Header",
  "prefix": "http://localhost:8080",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/example",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "User-Agent: <%25=Runtime.getRuntime().exec('calc')%25>",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "Application Error|Syntax Error|Execution failed",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential Code Injection Vulnerability detected in HTTP Headers",
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
          "index": 3
        }
      ],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```
**Explanation:**
- This script sends a request with a specially crafted User-Agent header designed to inject code.
- As before, the response is checked for any error messages or evidence of code execution.

**Resources and Detailed Zest Scripting:**
For constructing these scripts, refer to the Zest Scripting Documentation for ZAP which details elements such as actions, conditionals, requests, and assertions essential for robust scripting【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】【4:5†source】【4:6†source】【4:7†source】【4:8†source】【4:9†source】【4:10†source】【4:11†source】【4:12†source】【4:13†source】【4:14†source】【4:15†source】【4:16†source】【4:17†source】【4:18†source】【4:19†source】.

This approach ensures a comprehensive and detailed mechanism for detecting Code Injection vulnerabilities, reducing the rates of false positives and negatives.
