# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in C#

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')

#### Concept
Improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement, also known as Expression Language Injection (EL Injection), occurs when user-provided data is processed by the application in an Expression Language (EL) context without proper escaping. This lack of proper handling can allow attackers to manipulate the expression to execute potentially malicious code.

#### Manifestation in C# Web Applications
In C# web applications, specifically those built with frameworks that support dynamic expressions like Razor, EL Injection vulnerabilities can arise. For instance, if user input is incorporated directly into Razor expressions without adequate validation or escaping, attackers can manipulate the input to perform actions beyond their intended scope.

Common injection points include:
- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies and session variables

Typical indicators of a successful attack may include:
- Unintended rendering of user-provided input
- Syntax errors originating from user inputs
- Execution of arbitrary code leading to unexpected behavior

### Creating OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts to Detect EL Injection Vulnerabilities

Zest is a security scripting language offered by OWASP ZAP to automate web security testing. The following sections detail the steps to create effective Zest scripts for detecting various forms of EL Injection.

#### Zest Script Components
1. **Requests**: Define the HTTP requests targeting potential injection points.
2. **Assertions**: Verify the conditions which indicate a successful injection.
3. **Conditionals**: Branching logic based on custom conditions to check responses.
4. **Actions**: Define actions like marking the request as failed if a vulnerability is detected.

#### Example Script

Here is an example Zest script to detect EL Injection vulnerabilities in a C# web application:

```json
{
    "about": "Detect EL Injection in C# web applications",
    "zestVersion": "0.8",
    "statements": [
        // Step 1: Send a basic request with a test payload
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/vulnerable_endpoint",
            "method": "GET",
            "parameters": "input=${7*7}",
            "elementType": "ZestRequest",
            "index": 0
        },
        // Step 2: Validate if the payload is evaluated
        {
            "if": {
                "index": 1,
                "regex": "49",
                "location": "RESPONSE_BODY",
                "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
            },
            "then": [
                {
                    "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
                    "message": "EL Injection vulnerability detected"
                }
            ],
            "else": [],
            "elementType": "ZestConditional"
        }
    ],
    "parameters": {
        "tokenStart": "${",
        "tokenEnd": "}",
        "tokens": {},
        "elementType": "ZestVariables"
    },
    "prefix": "http://example.com",
    "title": "EL Injection Test Script",
    "description": "This script tests for EL Injection vulnerabilities in a C# web application."
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Request Definition**:
   - This request sends a GET request to a suspected vulnerable endpoint, injecting a payload `input=${7*7}`. 
   - The payload `${7*7}` will be evaluated to `49` if the application processes it as an EL expression.

2. **Conditional Check**:
   - The Zest script includes a regex condition to check if the string `49` appears in the HTTP response body.
   - If the condition is met, indicating an EL Injection vulnerability, the script performs a `fail` action, marking it as a finding.

### Steps for Customization and Enhancement
- Adjust the `url` and `parameters` based on specific endpoints of the target application.
- Include additional payloads testing different parts of the EL syntax.
- Implement more sophisticated validation logic using multiple conditionals and assertions to handle complex responses.

### Conclusion

This Zest script example offers a starting point for automating the detection of EL Injection vulnerabilities in C# web applications using OWASP ZAP. By integrating and customizing similar scripts, security testers can effectively discover and mitigate security risks related to improper neutralization of special elements used in expression language statements, ensuring robust application security.
