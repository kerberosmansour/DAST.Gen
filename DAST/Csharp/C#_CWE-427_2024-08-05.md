# Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in C#

###### What is an Uncontrolled Search Path Element?

An Uncontrolled Search Path Element is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a user can control a fragment of a search path used by the application to locate executables or libraries. In C# web applications, this can often involve allowing user input to influence file paths or executable paths, potentially leading to malicious files being executed, causing damage or unauthorized access.

### How Uncontrolled Search Path Element Can be Exploited

An attacker could introduce malicious code or manipulate existing files on the server to exploit this vulnerability. For example, if the application dynamically loads a library based on user input, an attacker could provide a path to a malicious library that gets loaded and executed by the application.

### Common Injection Points

In C# web applications, common injection points for this kind of vulnerability include:

1. **URL Parameters**
2. **HTTP Request Bodies**
3. **HTTP Headers**
4. **Form Inputs**
5. **File Upload Fields**

### Variations and Examples in C#

1. **Direct Path Manipulation**:
   Manipulation via direct changes to file paths using user input.

   ```csharp
   string filePath = "/usr/local/data/" + userInput + ".txt";
   File.ReadAllText(filePath);
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Environment variables influencing executable search paths.

   ```csharp
   Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", userControlledPath);
   var process = new Process();
   process.StartInfo.FileName = "somecommand";
   process.Start();
   ```

### Indicators of Success

Typical indicators of success include:

- **File Manipulation**: Unexpected files being created, modified, or read.
- **Unexpected Execution**: Execution of files or commands that were not intended by the application.
- **Error Responses**: Error messages indicating that a particular path or resource was not found, especially when it references a user-controlled input.

### Explanation of the Zest Components

1. **Metadata (`meta`)**: Provides a title and description for the script to clarify what vulnerability it is testing for.
2. **Actions (`actions`)**:
   - **ZestActionRequest**: Sends HTTP requests with placeholders (`{inject}`) where user input will be substituted to test for vulnerabilities.
3. **Conditions (`conditions`)**:
   - **ZestConditionResponseStatusCode**: Checks the response status code to identify whether the injection attempt was processed successfully. An HTTP 200 status code indicates the URL or request was processed, potentially revealing a vulnerability.
   - **ZestActionFail**: Triggers if the condition is met, indicating a potential vulnerability.

These scripts aim to test for Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerabilities by injecting path-related input into different parts of a web application request, and then checking the response to see if the application processes the input in a potentially unsafe way. The Zest script structure can readily be adjusted to cater to different types of input vectors and expected responses  .
