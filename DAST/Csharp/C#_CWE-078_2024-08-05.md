# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-078) in C#

###### Understanding Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** occurs when applications do not properly sanitize inputs before including them in OS commands. This leaves the application vulnerable to attackers who can inject malicious commands to be executed by the operating system.

#### Exploitation
- **Application Layer**: Attackers manipulate input fields such as form parameters, URLs, headers, or cookies to introduce OS command syntax (e.g., `;`, `&&`, `|`).
- **Command Execution**: The application executes these commands without proper validation, leading to unauthorized command execution on the server.

### Identifying Common Injection Points

In C# Web Applications (ASP.NET Core, MVC):
- **Query Parameters**: URL parameters can be manipulated.
- **Form Data**: User inputs in web forms.
- **Headers** and **Cookies**: HTTP headers and cookies can be tampered with to inject commands.
- **File Uploads**: Malicious inputs can be uploaded as part of the file metadata.
  
### HTTP Response Indicators of Success

When evaluating if an attempted OS command injection is successful:
- **Unexpected Responses**: Look for unusual output in response bodies (e.g., command output).
- **Response Codes**: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error often indicates execution failure due to injected commands.
- **Timing Discrepancies**: Abnormal response times indicating server-side processing delays due to injection.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for Detection

Given the nature of OS command injection and C# web applications, the following steps outline creating Zest scripts to detect these vulnerabilities:

1. **Set up Initial Requests**: Craft HTTP requests that carry injection payloads.
2. **Apply Conditionals**: Use regex or string matches to detect symptoms of successful injections.
3. **Assertions and Fail Actions**: Implement assertions to verify abnormal responses and use fail actions to flag detections.

#### Example Zest Script for Query Parameter Injection

```json
{
  "about": "Detect OS Command Injection via Query Parameters",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "OS Command Injection Detection - Query Parameters",
  "description": "Script to detect OS command injection vulnerabilities via query parameters.",
  "prefix": "http://targetapplication.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetapplication.com/vulnerablePage?input=;ls",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "bin|boot|dev|etc|lib",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential OS Command Injection found in query parameter.",
          "index": 3,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

- **Request Initialization**: `ZestRequest` element sends an HTTP GET request with a command injection payload.
- **Detection Mechanism**: `ZestConditionRegex` checks if typical file directory names (`bin`, `boot`, etc.) appear in the response bodyâ€”indicative of command execution.
- **Fail Action**: If regex condition is met, `ZestActionFail` marks the test as failed, indicating potential vulnerability.

#### Example Zest Script for POST Data Injection

```json
{
  "about": "Detect OS Command Injection via POST Data",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "OS Command Injection Detection - POST Data",
  "description": "Script to detect OS command injection vulnerabilities via POST data.",
  "prefix": "http://targetapplication.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://targetapplication.com/vulnerablePage",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "input=;id",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "regex": "uid=[0-9]+\\(root\\)",
      "location": "BODY",
      "ifStatements": [
        {
          "message": "Potential OS Command Injection found in POST data.",
          "index": 3,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ],
      "index": 2,
      "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

- **Request Initialization**: `ZestRequest` sends an HTTP POST request with a payload attempting to execute `id`.
- **Detection Mechanism**: `ZestConditionRegex` looks for patterns matching user ID returns for the `root` user.
- **Fail Action**: Triggers if the condition detects OS command execution results.

### Explanation of Zest Components for These Scripts

- **ZestRequest**: Defines HTTP requests with specified URLs, methods, and data parameters.
- **ZestConditionRegex**: Evaluates response content using regular expressions.
- **ZestActionFail**: Flags the script indicating potential vulnerability.

These scripts provide a reliable approach to identifying OS command injection vulnerabilities by using typical command injection payloads and detecting their responses.
