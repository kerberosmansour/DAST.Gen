# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917) in Ruby

#### Overview of Expression Language Injection

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') is a type of injection vulnerability where an attacker can inject arbitrary expression language constructs into a web application. This can lead to unintended execution of code, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate data, execute arbitrary commands, or potentially achieve remote code execution.

### Common Injection Points

- **URL Parameters:** Directly accepting user input as part of the URL.
- **HTTP Request Bodies:** Application processes input from POST requests or form submissions.
- **HTTP Headers:** Headers that might be used dynamically within the application.
- **Cookies:** Cookie values that might be evaluated or parsed by the server.
- **Query Strings:** Query parameters that are processed by the server-side application.

### Variations and How This Appears in Ruby Applications

Ruby web applications, particularly those using frameworks like Rails, can be vulnerable if they insufficiently sanitize or evaluate user-supplied data dynamically using the `eval` function or similar dynamic evaluation methods.

## Typical Indicators of Success

The typical patterns and indicators of successful expression language injection include:

1. **Error Messages:** Specific error messages indicating the evaluation of injected expressions.
2. **Manipulated Responses:** Detection of arbitrary data or evaluative responses inserted in the application's reply.
3. **Out-of-band Data Retrieval:** Unexpected HTTP responses or redirected commands executed on the server.

## ZAP Zest Scripts for Detecting Expression Language Injection

### Script Structure

1. **ZestRequest:** Simulates the crafted request containing the potential injection payloads.
2. **ZestAction:** Any manipulation of requests and responses during the script execution.
3. **ZestAssertion:** Verifies whether the response indicates a successful injection attack.
4. **ZestExpression:** Adds logic for control flows, such as conditional checks and loop constructs.

### Example Scripts for Specific Injection Points:

#### 1. URL Parameters Injection

{
  "title": "EL Injection via URL Parameters",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/search?q={{7*7}}",
      "method": "GET",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "49",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

#### 2. HTTP Request Body Injection

```json
{
  "title": "EL Injection via POST Body",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/submit",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "input={{4+4}}",
      "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "8",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

#### 3. HTTP Header Injection

```json
{
  "title": "EL Injection via Headers",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": "X-EL-Header: {{5*5}}",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "25",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

## Explanation and Documentation

### Explanation of the Vulnerability

Expression Language Injection vulnerabilities occur when user inputs are not properly sanitized and are directly evaluated within an expression language context. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious expressions that the server subsequently evaluates and executes, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or remote code execution.

### Script Logic

- **URL Parameter Injection Script:** This sends a GET request with an expression language payload in the URL parameter and subsequently checks the response body for evaluated results.
- **HTTP Request Body Injection Script:** This sends a POST request with a payload in the body of the request and verifies for the expected outcome in the server's response.
- **HTTP Header Injection Script:** This script injects the payload into a custom HTTP header and checks the response for signs of successful evaluation.

### Reasoning for Injection Points and Assertion Choices

- **URL Parameters and Query Strings:** Frequently parsed or evaluated by the server without proper sanitation.
- **Request Bodies:** Dynamic forms and API endpoints that directly handle user inputs.
- **Headers:** Less commonly sanitized, potentially leading to overlooked injection points.
- **Assertions:** Designed to detect successful evaluation of injected expressions by matching expected output patterns in the server responses, thus minimizing false positives and negatives.

## Conclusion

These Zest scripts aid in automating the detection of improper neutralization vulnerabilities in expression languages for Ruby applications. They target different injection points, from URL parameters to request headers, ensuring comprehensive coverage against potential attack vectors.

The thorough design logic and focus on accurate detection through content checks in server responses, ensures that the rate of false positives and negatives is minimized, thus fostering more reliable security testing   .
