# Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) in PHP

###### Understanding Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information Vulnerabilities

**Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information** refers to the practice where sensitive data (such as authentication credentials, personal information, or financial data) is transmitted over a network without encryption, making it susceptible to interception and unauthorized access. When a web application, especially written in PHP, sends or receives sensitive information in plaintext format, it exposes users and the system to significant security risks. Typically, attackers can intercept this data using network sniffing tools, leading to potential data breaches and various other security issues.

### Variations and Common Injection Points

Cleartext transmission issues can appear in various forms:
1. **URL Parameters:** Transmission of sensitive data within the URL.
2. **HTTP Request Bodies:** Sending sensitive data in the body of HTTP requests.
3. **HTTP Headers:** Including sensitive data in request or response headers.
4. **Cookies:** Storing sensitive data in cookies without proper encryption.
5. **Query Strings:** Utilizing query strings to transmit sensitive information.

These vulnerabilities are especially prevalent in PHP applications due to how data is typically handled in PHP frameworks and popular CMSs.

### Indicators of Success

To detect cleartext transmission vulnerabilities, look for patterns and indicators in HTTP responses such as:
- Plaintext sensitive data in URL, headers, or body responses.
- Absence of secure HTTP headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`.
- Non-implementation of transport layer security (HTTPS).
- Examination of cookie attributes (e.g., `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags absent).

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

Zest scripting is ideal for automating the detection of these vulnerabilities. Here are steps and sample scripts to achieve this:

1. **Detecting URL Parameters Transmission:**
   - **ZestRequest:** Define a request to simulate normal and attacker requests.
   - **ZestAssertion:** Check if the sensitive data is returned in the response URL.
   - **ZestCondition:** Add conditions to match sensitive data patterns.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "ZestScript",
     "title": "Detect URL Parameter Cleartext Transmission",
     "description": "Detects if sensitive information is transmitted via URL parameters.",
     "steps": [
       {
         "url": "http://example.com/login.php?username=admin&password=password",
         "method": "GET",
         "headers": "",
         "index": 1,
         "elementType": "ZestRequest"
       },
       {
         "rootExpression": {
           "regex": "password",
           "location": "URL",
           "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
         },
         "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Detecting Sensitive Data in HTTP Request Bodies:**
   - **ZestRequest:** Simulate a POST request containing sensitive data.
   - **ZestAssertion:** Ensure sensitive data is not visible in body response.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "ZestScript",
     "title": "Detect HTTP Body Cleartext Transmission",
     "description": "Detects if sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext within HTTP body.",
     "steps": [
       {
         "url": "http://example.com/login.php",
         "method": "POST",
         "data": "username=admin&password=password",
         "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
         "index": 1,
         "elementType": "ZestRequest"
       },
       {
         "rootExpression": {
           "regex": "password",
           "location": "BODY",
           "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
         },
         "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Detecting Sensitive Data in HTTP Headers:**
   - **ZestRequest:** Craft requests that might include sensitive headers.
   - **ZestAssertion:** Check if headers are appropriately encrypted or sensitive data is not present.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "ZestScript",
     "title": "Detect HTTP Headers Cleartext Transmission",
     "description": "Detects if sensitive information is transmitted in HTTP headers.",
     "steps": [
       {
         "url": "http://example.com/dashboard.php",
         "method": "GET",
         "headers": "Authorization: Basic admin:password",
         "index": 1,
         "elementType": "ZestRequest"
       },
       {
         "rootExpression": {
           "regex": "password",
           "location": "HEADER",
           "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
         },
         "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Detecting Sensitive Data in Cookies:**
   - **ZestRequest:** Simulate request setting sensitive cookies.
   - **ZestAssertion:** Verify secure flag presence and encryption.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "ZestScript",
     "title": "Detect Cookie Cleartext Transmission",
     "description": "Detects if sensitive information is transmitted or stored in cleartext within cookies.",
     "steps": [
       {
         "url": "http://example.com/set_cookie.php",
         "method": "GET",
         "headers": "",
         "index": 1,
         "elementType": "ZestRequest"
       },
       {
         "rootExpression": {
           "regex": "secure",
           "location": "COOKIE",
           "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
         },
         "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Explanation of the Scripts

1. **URL Parameter Cleartext Transmission Script:** This script sends a GET request with sensitive information in the URL to see if it appears back in the server's response URL.
2. **HTTP Body Cleartext Transmission Script:** It checks if sensitive information supplied in the body of POST requests can be intercepted.
3. **HTTP Headers Cleartext Transmission Script:** This script tests for transmission of cleartext sensitive data in the HTTP headers, specifically looking for patterns indicating credentials or session tokens.
4. **Cookie Cleartext Transmission Script:** It verifies if sensitive data is securely transmitted or stored within cookies by assessing the presence of secure attributes and cookie encryption.

These scripts leverage Zest components like `ZestRequest`, `ZestAssertion`, and `ZestCondition` to ensure detection accuracy and automation within the ZAP environment, minimizing false positives and negatives【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:2†source】【4:3†source】.
