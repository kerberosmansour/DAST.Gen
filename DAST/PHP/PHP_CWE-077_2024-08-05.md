# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-077) in PHP

#### Explanation of Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')

### What is Command Injection?

Command Injection occurs when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data (input) to a system shell. It's a type of injection vulnerability where an attacker can alter the intended command execution flow of the program. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the host operating system via the vulnerable application.

### How It Manifests

In PHP, Command Injection often happens when `system()`, `shell_exec()`, `exec()`, `proc_open()`, or `eval()` functions are used incorrectly. For example:

```php
<?php
$input = $_GET['input'];
system("ls " . $input);
?>
```

If `input` is not sanitized, an attacker could supply `; rm -rf /` as the input, resulting in the execution of both `ls` and `rm -rf /`, potentially deleting critical files.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of Command Injection can lead to the complete compromise of the affected web server. Attackers can read system files, damage the system, or use the compromised server to launch further attacks.

### Common Injection Points

- URL parameters
- HTTP request bodies
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

## Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for Detecting Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in PHP Web Applications

To effectively detect command injection vulnerabilities, we should craft Zest scripts that cover various common injection points and command syntax. Zest scripts are ideal for this purpose due to their integration with OWASP ZAP and their ability to perform sophisticated logic and conditional flows.

### Example Scripts

The following example demonstrates a Zest Script testing URL parameters for Command Injection vulnerabilities. The script will use HTTP GET method to inject payloads and validate if the injection is successful by checking specific indicators in the response.

#### Zest Script for URL Parameters

```json
{
  "about": "Zest Script for detecting Command Injection via URL parameters in PHP web applications.",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Detect Command Injection - URL Parameters",
  "description": "This script tests for Command Injection vulnerabilities in URL parameters using common payloads.",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?param=",
      "method": "GET",
      "data": "",
      "headers": "",
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "root:",
            "location": "BODY",
            "not": false,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "index": 0,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest",
      "followRedirects": true
    },
    {
      "type": "javascript",
      "action": "test_payloads",
      "elementType": "ZestActionScript"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "test_payloads": {
      "type": "javascript",
      "script": "var payloads = ['; id', '| id', '&& id', '|| id', '`id`'];\nfor(var i = 0; i < payloads.length; i++) {\n    var request = zestRequest.clone();\n    request.setUrl(request.getUrl() + encodeURIComponent(payloads[i]));\n    zestClient.send(request);\n    var response = request.getResponse();\n    if(response && response.getBody().contains('uid=')) {\n        zestResult.fail('Command Injection Detected with payload: ' + payloads[i]);\n    }\n}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **ZestRequest**: Defines the initial HTTP GET request targeting a hypothetical vulnerable PHP endpoint. The base URL is `http://example.com/vulnerable.php?param=`.
2. **ZestActionScript**: Executes the JavaScript function `test_payloads`, which will iterate over a list of known dangerous payloads (`['; id', '| id', '&& id', '|| id', '`id`']`).
3. **Assertions**: Each payload is tested by sending a modified request and checking the response body for indicators of command execution, such as Unix user ID output (`uid=`).

### Comprehensive Script with Multiple Injection Points

```json
{
  "about": "Zest Script for detecting Command Injection via multiple injection points in PHP web applications.",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "Detect Command Injection - Multiple Injection Points",
  "description": "This script tests for Command Injection vulnerabilities in URL parameters, headers, and body using common payloads.",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "statements": [
    {"...": "..."},
    {
      "type": "javascript",
      "action": "test_all_injections",
      "elementType": "ZestActionScript"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "test_all_injections": {
      "type": "javascript",
      "script": "var payloads = ['; id', '| id', '&& id', '|| id', '`id`'];\n"
                + "var injection_points = [\'url_param\', \'header\', \'body\'];\n"
                + "for(var i = 0; i < payloads.length; i++) {\n"
                + "    for(var j = 0; j < injection_points.length; j++) {\n"
                + "        var request = zestRequest.clone();\n"
                + "        if(injection_points[j] == 'url_param') {\n"
                + "            request.setUrl(request.getUrl() + encodeURIComponent(payloads[i]));\n"
                + "        } else if(injection_points[j] == 'header') {\n"
                + "            request.setHeader('X-Test-Header', payloads[i]);\n"
                + "        } else if(injection_points[j] == 'body') {\n"
                + "            request.setData('param=' + encodeURIComponent(payloads[i]));\n"
                + "        }\n"
                + "        zestClient.send(request);\n"
                + "        var response = request.getResponse();\n"
                + "        if(response && response.getBody().contains('uid=')) {\n"
                + "            zestResult.fail('Command Injection Detected in ' + injection_points[j] + ' with payload: ' + payloads[i]);\n"
                + "        }\n"
                + "    }\n"
                + "}\n"
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- This script thoroughly checks multiple points (`url_param`, `header`, `body`) for Command Injection using the same payload set.
- The JavaScript function iterates through each payload and each injection point, modifying the request accordingly before sending it out and validating the response.
