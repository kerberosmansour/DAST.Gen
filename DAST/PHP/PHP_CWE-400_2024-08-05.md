# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in PHP

###### Understanding Uncontrolled Resource Consumption 

**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** is a vulnerability where an application does not impose any limits on the use of resources such as CPU, memory, storage, or network bandwidth. Attackers can exploit this by sending a large number of requests or resource-heavy operations, causing the server to become unresponsive, ultimately leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. In PHP web applications, this might manifest in various ways, including but not limited to, file uploads without size restrictions, unbounded loops, or poorly managed database queries.

### Common Injection Points

1. **URL parameters**: e.g., `http://example.com?param=largeValue`
2. **HTTP request bodies**: e.g., JSON payloads with large data structures.
3. **HTTP headers**: e.g., oversized headers.
4. **Cookies**: e.g., large cookie values.
5. **Query strings**: e.g., `search=term1&search=term2&...&search=termN`.

### Indicators of Success

Indicators that suggest the presence of uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities may include:
- **HTTP status codes**: 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable.
- **Error messages**: Specific application error messages indicating resource exhaustion.
- **Response time**: Significantly increased response times.
- **Response length**: Abnormally large responses.

### Creating OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

Below is an example to detect uncontrolled resource consumption by crafting a large payload in the HTTP request body.

#### 1. Large Payload in HTTP Request Body

```json
{
  "zestScripts": [
    {
      "title": "Detect large payload in HTTP POST request body causing resource consumption issues",
      "description": "This script sends a large JSON payload to a target URL and checks for indicators of resource consumption issues.",
      "startIndex": 0,
      "zestStatements": [
        {
          "url": "http://example.com/endpoint",
          "method": "POST",
          "data": "{\"largeKey\":\"" + "a".repeat(1000000) + "\"}",
          "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
          },
          "index": 0,
          "elementType": "ZestRequest"
        },
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 500,
            "not": false,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          },
          "index": 1,
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        },
        {
          "message": "Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability Detected",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. URL Parameter causing Unbounded Resource Use

```json
{
  "zestScripts": [
    {
      "title": "Detect unbounded resource use via large URL parameters",
      "description": "This script sends a GET request with a large query parameter value to test for uncontrolled resource consumption.",
      "startIndex": 0,
      "zestStatements": [
        {
          "url": "http://example.com/service?param=" + "a".repeat(10000),
          "method": "GET",
          "index": 0,
          "elementType": "ZestRequest"
        },
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "code": 503,
            "not": false,
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
          },
          "index": 1,
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        },
        {
          "message": "Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability Detected",
          "index": 2,
          "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Documentation Explanation

1. **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: This vulnerability allows attackers to exhaust system resources by sending excessive requests or resource-heavy operations. In PHP web applications, this may include large file uploads, inefficient loops, or extensive database queries. 

2. **Script Logic**:
   - **Large Payload in HTTP Request Body**: This script sends a large JSON object in a POST request to test if the server can handle unexpected large inputs. The response's status code is checked to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - **URL Parameter causing Unbounded Resource Use**: This script performs a GET request with a very large query parameter value. It checks for server responses indicating resource over-usage, such as 503 errors.

3. **Indicators and Assertions**: By using `ZestExpressionStatusCode`, `ZestActionFail`, and similar constructs, these scripts incorporate logic to detect common signs of uncontrolled resource consumption.

### Conclusion

By incorporating large data inputs into different parts of HTTP requests, these Zest scripts detect uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities. Assertions are used to check typical indicators in HTTP responses, such as 500 or 503 status codes, which suggest that an application may be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.
