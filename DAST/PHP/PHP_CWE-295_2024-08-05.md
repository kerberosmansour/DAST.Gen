# Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) in PHP

****Understanding Improper Certificate Validation in PHP Applications**

**Improper Certificate Validation** is a serious vulnerability that occurs when an application does not validate SSL/TLS certificates properly, potentially allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In PHP applications, this vulnerability often manifests in the following ways:

1. **Ignoring Certificate Validation Errors**: PHP functions like `file_get_contents`, `curl`, and others that deal with HTTP requests can be configured to ignore SSL errors improperly.
2. **Using Outdated or Insecure Libraries**: Libraries like `OpenSSL` provide the necessary methods to validate SSL/TLS certificates, but if misconfigured or outdated, they can introduce risks.
3. **Custom Certificate Verification**: Custom implementation for certificate verification can lead to errors if not done accurately.

**Common Injection Points**:
- URL Parameters: Used in APIs or web services to fetch data from remote servers.
- HTTP Request Bodies: JSON or XML payloads sent to remote servers.
- HTTP Headers: Custom headers that might include authorization tokens.
- Cookies: Sensitive data stored in cookies that rely on SSL/TLS for protection.
- Query Strings: Parameters in URLs that might be intercepted.

**Indicators of Successful Exploitation**:
- Status codes (e.g., 200 OK even when there should be SSL errors).
- Unexpected or missing error messages in the response body.
- Indicators in headers that SSL/TLS validation was bypassed.

**Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for Detection**

Zest scripts in OWASP ZAP can be used to automate the detection of Improper Certificate Validation. The script should have components to send specific requests and check responses for known patterns indicating the vulnerability.

### Example 1: Test for Ignoring SSL Verification in `curl` Requests

```json
{
  "title": "Test SSL validation in curl requests",
  "description": "Detect SSL validation bypass in curl requests in PHP applications",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "type": "standalone",
  "order": [],
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/",  // A site with a bad SSL certificate
      "index": 1,
      "headers": []
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
        "code": 200,
        "not": false
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
      "index": 2
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Potential SSL bypass detected in curl requests",
      "index": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Test for Ignoring SSL Errors in `file_get_contents`

```json
{
  "title": "Test SSL validation in file_get_contents",
  "description": "Detect SSL validation bypass in file_get_contents in PHP applications",
  "prefix": "http://example.com",
  "type": "standalone",
  "order": [],
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://self-signed.badssl.com/",  // A site with a self-signed certificate
      "index": 1,
      "headers": []
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
        "code": 200,
        "not": false
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
      "index": 2
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "Potential SSL bypass detected in file_get_contents",
      "index": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Components

1. **ZestRequest**: Creates a request to a known endpoint with a bad SSL configuration (`url` with `https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/`, `https://self-signed.badssl.com/`).
2. **ZestAssertion**: Checks the HTTP response status code. If the status code is `200 OK`, it indicates the request succeeded, potentially bypassing SSL validation. This should fail for endpoints with bad SSL if proper certificate validation is in place.
3. **ZestActionFail**: If the assertion is true (indicating the request was successful despite SSL issues), the script logs a failure with a message.

### Reducing False Positives and False Negatives

- **False Positives**: Ensure that test URLs are correct and actually have SSL issues. Validate manually if possible.
- **False Negatives**: Check the configuration of PHP functions used in the application, as different methods may need separate tests.

These scripts use standardized test endpoints to determine if improper SSL validation is occurring, flagging potential vulnerabilities for further investigation.
