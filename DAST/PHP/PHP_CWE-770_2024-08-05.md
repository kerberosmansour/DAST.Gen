# Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in PHP

###### Understanding Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling Vulnerabilities

**What is Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling?**

Allocation of resources without limits or throttling is a security vulnerability where an application fails to place reasonable limits on resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can lead to resource exhaustion, making the application or entire system unavailable, or severely degrading performance. In web applications, common targets for such attacks include APIs, authentication endpoints, and any functionality that processes user input.

**Common PHP Scenarios:**

1. **File Uploads without Limits**: Web applications allowing file uploads without size restrictions.
2. **No Limits on Concurrent Requests**: APIs that accept unlimited requests per user.
3. **No Pagination on Data Retrieval**: Endpoints returning large amounts of data without pagination.
4. **Uncontrolled Email Sending**: Forms or functions that send emails without a throttle on the rate.
5. **Unrestricted Data Processing**: Processing tasks such as image conversions or data filtering that can trigger heavy server load without limits.

### Variations and Common Injection Points

When considering allocation of resources without limits or throttling, it is necessary to look at common points within a web application where these issues may occur:

1. **URL Parameters**: These might include parameters for APIs or other endpoints.
2. **HTTP Request Bodies**: Particularly relevant for file uploads or data processing.
3. **HTTP Headers**: Headers like ‘Content-Length’ may be manipulated.
4. **Cookies**: Large or numerous cookie values can be set.
5. **Query Strings**: Accessing resources based on user-supplied queries without limits.

### Indicators of Success

To detect these vulnerabilities specifically by observing:
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Errors (such as 500) may indicate the server is overloaded.
- **Response Times**: Unusual delays in response times.
- **Server Responses**: Specific messages indicating resource exhaustion (e.g., memory limits reached).

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

Below is a breakdown of the Zest script creation steps:

**1. Simulate File Uploads:**
   - `ZestRequest` to upload files exceeding expected limits multiple times.
   - `ZestAssertion` for HTTP 500 errors indicating resource strain.

```json
{
  "zestScript": {
    "title": "Detect Resource Exhaustion via File Upload",
    "requests": [
      {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "http://example.com/upload",
        "headers": [{"name": "Content-Type", "value": "multipart/form-data"}],
        "data": "<large_file_data>",
        "assertions": [
           {
            "rule": "Response Code Equals",
            "value": 500
           }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "actions": [
      {
        "actionType": "Repeat",
        "attributeName": "request",
        "value": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**2. Test No Limit on Concurrent API Calls:**
   - `ZestRequest` repeatedly triggering API calls.
   - `ZestExpression` to simulate concurrent requests and check server stability.

```json
{
  "zestScript": {
    "title": "Detect No Limits on Concurrent API Calls",
    "requests": [{
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "http://example.com/api/resource",
        "parameters": [{"name": "param", "value": "value"}],
        "assertions": [
          {
            "rule": "Response Code Equals",
            "value": 500
          }
        ]
    }],
    "actions": [
      {
        "actionType": "Loop",
        "iterations": 15,
        "actions": [
          {
            "actionType": "Send",
            "attributeName": "request",
            "value": ""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**3. Check for Pagination Enforcement:**
   - `ZestRequest` to access large datasets without pagination.
   - `ZestAssertion` for excessive data lengths or slow response times.

```json
{
  "zestScript": {
    "title": "Detect Lack of Pagination",
    "requests": [{
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "http://example.com/api/data?size=10000",
        "assertions": [
          {
            "rule": "Response Time Greater Than",
            "value": 5000
          },
          {
            "rule": "Response Body Size Greater Than",
            "value": 10000000
          }
        ]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **File Uploads:** The script sends a large file upload request repeatedly to check if the server can handle large files without breaking, indicated by a 500 error.
2. **Concurrent API Calls:** This simulates excessive API usage by looping multiple requests rapidly to see if the server can enforce rate limits.
3. **Pagination:** Accesses a large dataset via API to ensure pagination is enforced, looking for long response times or large response sizes.

### Conclusion

By implementing these Zest scripts in OWASP ZAP, security testers can effectively identify and verify allocation of resources without limits or throttling in PHP web applications, mitigating risks by enforcing appropriate resource usage policies. The provided scripts cater to the different injection points and scenarios typical to PHP applications, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.
