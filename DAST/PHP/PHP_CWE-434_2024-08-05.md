# Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434) in PHP

###### Explanation of Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type Vulnerabilities

**Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows an attacker to upload a file with potentially dangerous content (e.g., PHP scripts, executable files) without proper validation. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), where the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. 

In PHP web applications, these vulnerabilities can manifest if a developer fails to properly check the contents, file extension, or MIME type of the uploaded files. Even if these checks are in place, improper handling can still lead to bypasses. Some popular PHP frameworks where these vulnerabilities are common include Laravel, CodeIgniter, and Symfony.

### Identifying Common Injection Points

For Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerabilities in PHP applications, common injection points include:
- URL Parameters: An attacker might craft a URL to force the server to load a malicious file.
- HTTP Request Bodies and Multipart Data: This is the most common injection point where a file is directly uploaded.
- HTTP Headers and Cookies: Though less common, improper handling can lead to vulnerabilities.
- Query Strings: Similar to URL parameters, these can be an avenue if data is improperly handled.

### Indicators of Success
Positive detection indicators:
- Specific HTTP status codes, typically 200 for a successful upload.
- Response body content indicating file upload success (e.g., "File uploaded successfully").
- Error messages returning from the server that indicate improper validation.

Negative detection (false positive reduction):
- Error messages related to denied uploads (e.g., "Invalid file type") should negate the success detection.
- Specific status codes like 400 or 415 indicating rejection should also negate positive detection.

### Writing OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts

Here's an example Zest script to detect Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerabilities:

```json
{
  "zestScript": {
    "version": "0.5",
    "title": "Check for Unrestricted Upload of Dangerous File Types",
    "description": "This script detects if dangerous file types can be uploaded without restriction.",
    "statements": [
      {
        "url": "http://<target-url>/upload.php",
        "method": "POST",
        "data": "------WebKitFormBoundary\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"fileToUpload\"; filename=\"test.php\"\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n\r\n<?php echo 'Vulnerable'; ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundary--",
        "headers": "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary",
        "index": 0,
        "elementType": "ZestRequest"
      },
      {
        "rootExpression": {
          "code": 200,
          "not": false,
          "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
        },
        "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
      },
      {
        "regex": "File uploaded successfully",
        "location": "BODY",
        "ifStatements": [
          {
            "index": 1,
            "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
            "message": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability detected."
          }
        ],
        "elseStatements": [],
        "index": 2,
        "elementType": "ZestConditionRegex"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **ZestRequest**:
   - A POST request is made to the file upload endpoint (`/upload.php`) with a payload containing a PHP script (`test.php`). This simulates the dangerous file type upload.

2. **ZestAssertion**:
   - Checks if the response status code is 200, indicating that the upload was successful.

3. **ZestConditionRegex**:
   - Verifies the response body contains "File uploaded successfully". If this condition is true, a `ZestActionFail` action is triggered with a message indicating the vulnerability.

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives

To minimize false positives:
- Ensure the detection conditions are specific enough to eliminate legitimate failure or denial responses.
- Implement regex patterns that check for specific success messages beyond just status codes.

To minimize false negatives:
- Include different payload variations and content types.
- Consider common bypass techniques where file names or content are masked or altered.

These steps ensure that Zest scripts are precise and reliable, ensuring robust application security testing.
