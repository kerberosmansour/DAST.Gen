# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352) in PHP

#### Explanation of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### What is CSRF?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack where the attacker tricks an authenticated user into making an unwanted request to a web application in which they are currently authenticated. This allows the attacker to perform actions as the user without their knowledge.

### How CSRF Can Be Exploited
An attacker can exploit CSRF by getting the user to click on a malicious link, visit a malicious website, or open an email containing a malicious script. When this happens, the user's browser sends a request to the target application, performing actions using the user's credentials.

### Impact on Web Applications
If a CSRF attack is successful, it can result in unauthorized transactions, changes to user account settings, and data theft, among other malicious activities. Because the requests are made with valid credentials, they are difficult to detect and prevent without proper security measures.

### Common Injection Points
1. **URL Parameters**: The attacker includes hidden form parameters in the request URL.
2. **HTTP Request Bodies**: The attacker includes POST requests with hidden fields.
3. **HTTP Headers**: Custom headers might be manipulated to include unauthorized requests.
4. **Cookies**: Session cookies can be leveraged to make authenticated requests.
5. **Query Strings**: Leveraging query strings in URL to inject malicious commands.

## OWASP ZAP Zest Script for Detecting CSRF in PHP Applications

### Zest Components

1. **ZestRequest**: Defines the HTTP request that simulates a CSRF attack.
2. **ZestAssertion**: Verifies that the server response reflects an unauthorized action.
3. **ZestAction**: Includes the action taken based on the response (like failing the script if a vulnerability is detected).
4. **ZestExpression**: For conditional checks within the script.

### Example Zest Script

Below is an example of a Zest script to detect CSRF vulnerabilities by simulating a fake fund transfer in a banking application. The script illustrates how to create a request, include necessary headers, and assert a successful detection of CSRF.

```json
{
  "about": "CSRF Detection Script",
  "zestVersion": "0.3",
  "type": "ZEST_SCRIPT",
  "title": "CSRF Detection",
  "description": "Script to detect CSRF vulnerabilities in PHP applications",
  "statement": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/transfer",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": {
        "Cookie": "sessionid=abcdef1234567890;"
      },
      "data": "amount=1000&account=12345678",
      "index": 1,
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "rootExpression": {
        "code": 200,
        "not": false,
        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode"
      },
      "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
    },
    {
      "index": 3,
      "elementType": "ZestActionFail",
      "message": "CSRF vulnerability detected!"
    }
  ],
  "index": 0
}
```

## Logic Behind the Design

### Injection Points Targeted
1. **URL Parameters and Request Bodies**: The script uses POST data fields as common points for exploiting CSRF.
2. **Headers**: Inclusion of cookies to simulate an authenticated request.
3. **Query Strings**: An additional point to explore but not included in this script snippet for simplicity.

### Assertions and Indicators of Success
- **HTTP Status Code 200**: Assumes that a successful CSRF attack would return a status code 200. This can be replaced with more specific success indications based on the application behavior.
- **Fail Action**: Triggered if the status code assertion is true, indicating a vulnerability.

### Minimizing False Positives and False Negatives
- **Target-Specific Assertions**: Ensure assertions are application-specific to avoid incorrect detections.
- **Combination of Multiple Checks**: Use multiple indicators such as status codes and response content patterns together to improve accuracy.

### Advanced Features Considered
- **Reusable Actions**: Possible extraction of tokens or dynamic response handling for more complex scenarios.
- **Environmental Variables**: Store and utilize session IDs or CSRF tokens extracted from previous responses to simulate real interaction.

This script serves as a foundational template. Adjustments may be required based on the specific web application's response patterns and structure.
