# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-094) in PHP

###### Overview of Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') in PHP Web Applications

#### Understanding the Vulnerability

Improper Control of Generation of Code, commonly known as Code Injection, occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary code into an application due to insufficient validation or escaping of user inputs. This can lead to various forms of attacks, such as executing unauthorized commands or gaining unauthorized access to data.

##### Common Manifestations in PHP
In PHP web applications, Code Injection vulnerabilities typically manifest when user inputs are improperly handled before being passed to functions like `eval()`, `assert()`, or even when included in dynamically created files or templates. Popular PHP frameworks sometimes overlook secure coding practices, resulting in exploitable situations where user inputs might get directly embedded into the code execution context.

Common risky functions include:
- `eval()`
- `assert()`
- `preg_replace()` with the `/e` modifier
- Dynamic includes (e.g., `include`, `require`)

#### Injection Points and HTTP Request Components
Possible injection points in a web application, especially those written in PHP, include:
- **URL parameters**: Vulnerable endpoints that take parameters directly without validation.
- **HTTP request bodies**: Especially in POST requests, where inputs might be used in server-side scripts.
- **HTTP headers**: User-agent or other headers might be processed in a way that leads to code execution.
- **Cookies**: If the application reads cookies and uses them in code generation.
- **Query strings**: Commonly used in search functionalities or data retrieval mechanisms.

### Crafting Zest Scripts for Code Injection Detection

**Steps to Develop a Zest Script:**

1. **Define the `ZestRequest`**: This will simulate the attack vector with injection payloads.
2. **Incorporate `ZestAction`** elements: These will manipulate requests or responses if necessary.
3. **Use `ZestAssertion`**: This will verify expected responses indicating the presence of a vulnerability.
4. **Implement `ZestExpression`**: For logic and control flow, useful in handling complex scenarios and response content verification.

Following are example Zest scripts for different injection points:

#### Example 1: URL Parameter Code Injection Script

This script tests URL parameters for potential injection flaws.

```json
{
  "type": "ZestScript",
  "version": "0.3",
  "about": "Code Injection Check for URL Parameters",
  "parameters": {},
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/index.php?id=1; phpinfo();",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": [],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "rootExpression": {
          "type": "ZestExpressionRegex",
          "regex": "PHP Version",
          "location": "BODY"
        },
        "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example 2: POST Body Code Injection Script

This script tests HTTP POST requests for code injection vulnerabilities.

```json
{
  "type": "ZestScript",
  "version": "0.3",
  "about": "Code Injection Check for POST Body",
  "parameters": {},
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/login.php",
      "method": "POST",
      "data": "username=admin'&password=anything'&submit=Login",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "rootExpression": {
          "type": "ZestExpressionRegex",
          "regex": "password",
          "location": "BODY"
        },
        "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example 3: HTTP Header Code Injection Script

This script tests HTTP header values for potential code execution vulnerabilities.

```json
{
  "type": "ZestScript",
  "version": "0.3",
  "about": "Code Injection Check for HTTP Headers",
  "parameters": {},
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "ZestRequest",
      "url": "http://targetsite.com/",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "User-Agent",
          "value": "<?php phpinfo(); ?>"
        }
      ],
      "elementType": "ZestRequest"
    },
    {
      "type": "ZestAssertion",
      "rootExpression": {
        "rootExpression": {
          "type": "ZestExpressionRegex",
          "regex": "PHP Version",
          "location": "BODY"
        },
        "elementType": "ZestAssertion"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Indicators of Success

Indicators of vulnerability presence include:
- Specific error messages that reveal system information.
- Unexpected HTTP status codes.
- Presence of specific content in responses like "PHP Version" in response to code execution attempts.

### Writing Efficient Zest Scripts

While writing Zest scripts, it's crucial to structure them to reduce false positives and negatives. This involves:
- Crafting accurate regex for response validation.
- Ensuring the payloads cover a variety of common and edge cases.
- Using robust assertions to confirm that the indicators are indeed signs of an exploit.

#### Sample Explanation

The script tests the insertion of PHP code via various vectors (`URL`, `POST body`, `Headers`). If the response contains `PHP Version`, which is indicative of `phpinfo()` execution, the script registers a vulnerability.

Scripts also challenge typical scenarios like including payloads in:
- **URL Parameters** (direct code in the query string)
- **POST Bodies** (injected through form submissions)
- **HTTP Headers** (embedded in headers such as `User-Agent`)

By following this comprehensive approach, security testers can leverage Zest scripts within OWASP ZAP to effectively identify and mitigate Code Injection vulnerabilities in PHP web applications.
