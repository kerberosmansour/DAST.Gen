# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) in PHP

###### Overview of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**1. Understanding SSRF Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a security vulnerability where an attacker can make the server make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain. These requests might result in information disclosure or unauthorized actions on behalf of the attacker.
   - **Common Manifestations in PHP Applications:** SSRF vulnerabilities often occur in PHP applications when user-controlled input is used to fetch data from remote servers without proper validation. This manifests in URL parameters, POST bodies, HTTP headers, and other request components.
   - **Impact:** Exploiting SSRF can lead to unauthorized data access, inclusion of remote resources, bypassing firewall restrictions, and potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) in some configurations.

**2. Injection Points for SSRF:**
   - **URL Parameters:**
     ```php
     $content = file_get_contents($_GET['url']);
     ```
   - **POST Body:**
     ```php
     $url = $_POST['url'];
     $data = file_get_contents($url);
     ```
   - **HTTP Headers:**
     ```php
     $ch = curl_init();
     curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $_SERVER['HTTP_X_CUSTOM_URL']);
     $response = curl_exec($ch);
     ```
   - **Cookies:**
     ```php
     $url = $_COOKIE['target'];
     ```
   - **Query Strings:**
     Similarly handled as URL parameters.

**3. Key Indicators of Successful SSRF Exploitation:**
   - **HTTP Status Codes:** Responses with unusual status codes such as 500 Internal Server Error might indicate access to internal resources.
   - **Response Content:** Sensitive information, error messages, or content indicating internal resource access.
   - **Network Indicators:** Requests made to internal IP addresses (e.g., 127.0.0.1) or predefined endpoints.

### Creating OWASP ZAP Zest Scripts for SSRF Detection

**1. Zest Script Structure:**
   - **Requests (`ZestRequest`)**: To send HTTP requests to potential SSRF injection points.
   - **Assertions (`ZestAssertion`)**: To verify the indicators of SSRF exploitation.
   - **Actions (`ZestAction`)**: To manipulate requests or control flow.
   - **Conditionals (`ZestCondition`)**: To create complex logical flows within the script.

**2. Example Zest Script in JSON:**
Here's an example Zest script that checks for SSRF via URL parameters.

```json
{
    "title": "SSRF Detection in URL Parameters",
    "description": "Detects SSRF vulnerabilities by sending requests to internal IPs and verifying responses.",
    "statements": [
        {
            "elementType": "ZestRequest",
            "index": 1,
            "method": "GET",
            "url": "http://target-website.com/page?url=http://127.0.0.1/admin",
            "headers": "",
            "assertions": [
                {
                    "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
                    "rootExpression": {
                        "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
                        "code": 200
                    }
                },
                {
                    "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
                    "rootExpression": {
                        "elementType": "ZestExpressionBodyRegex",
                        "regex": "admin"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**3. Creating Additional Scripts for Various Injection Points:**

              "index": 2,
              "method": "POST",
              "url": "http://target-website.com/api/submit",
              "data": "url=http://127.0.0.1/admin",
              "headers": "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
              "assertions": [
                  {
                      "elementType": "ZestAssertion",
                      "rootExpression": {
                          "elementType": "ZestExpressionStatusCode",
                          "code": 200

                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
  }

### Explanation and Documentation

1. **Explanation of SSRF:**
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a serious web security vulnerability that allows attackers to send unauthorized requests from a server-side application to other systems, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure, internal network access, and, in severe cases, Remote Code Execution (RCE).

2. **Script Logic Overview:**
   - For each script, a `ZestRequest` is defined to simulate the SSRF payload.
   - `ZestAssertion` elements are used to inspect the HTTP responses for indications of SSRF, such as matching a status code or regex patterns in the response body.
   - Scripts are designed to test different common SSRF injection points, ensuring wide coverage with minimal false positives and false negatives.
